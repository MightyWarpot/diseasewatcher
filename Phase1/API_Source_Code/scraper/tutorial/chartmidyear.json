It is a fatal disorder, often leading to death within just several years of the onset. CJD is the most common form of a human disorder caused by \u201cprions,\u201d pathogenic agents that induce abnormal folding of specific cellular proteins in the brain called \u201cprion proteins.\u201d The major type of CJD, accounting for 85% of the cases, is called sporadic CJD (sCJD). Because sCJD mainly occurs in late-middle old age, an increase in the aging population worldwide can potentially cause a rise in CJD cases, which is a pressing global concern. Thus, to help policymakers plan ahead and establish a robust strategy, it is essential to estimate the trends of CJD-associated deaths and incidence.", "To this end, a team of researchers at Okayama University, including Dr Yoshito Nishimura, Dr Toshihiro Koyama, and Dr Hideharu Hagiya, conducted a trend analysis of the incidence and mortality of CJD in Japan, between 2005 and 2014. Their findings are published in", ", a Nature Research journal. Dr Nishimura, the first author of this study, says, \u201cDespite CJD being a rare disease, the phenomenon of population aging may trigger a rise in the incidence and, thus, the socioeconomic and healthcare burden of CJD. Our aim was to analyze these trends, in an effort to spread awareness and spur new treatment strategies.\u201d", "For their analysis, the scientists used national vital statistics data on CJD-associated deaths among individuals aged over 50 years as well as the government-funded nationwide CJD surveillance data (from 2005 to 2014) in Japan. Their analysis revealed that, from 2005 to 2014, there was a significant increase in the absolute number of deaths, mortality rates, and incidence rates associated with CJD, even after adjusting for age. In particular, the average increase in incidence was estimated to be 6.4% per year. This trend in CJD-associated mortality and incidence rates was especially prominent in the older-age group, particularly in those over the age of 70 years. Although a previous report by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease International Surveillance Network had stated that annual death rates of sCJD had risen in most participating countries in the past two decades, this study shows that Japan might have had higher CJD-associated deaths and incidence than other countries, which the scientists attributed to a rise in the aging population. Dr Nishimura says, \u201cThe severe socioeconomic burden on caregivers due to CJD-induced dementia warrant the attention of policymakers and stress the need for a mitigative action plan with particular focus on the increase in the prevalence of dementia. In this regard, we hope that our findings can help to guide policymakers in the right direction.\u201d", "In 2015, more than 4.7 million people in Japan were living with dementia, and this number is projected to rapidly increase to 7 million by 2025. Contrary to other forms of dementia, which progress relatively slowly, patients with CJD suffer from rapidly progressing dementia. Thus, there is an urgent need to find effective strategies to improve their quality of lives and reduce the burden on caregivers. The findings of this study take a step in this direction, by shedding light on the need for effective policy measures. Dr Nishimura concludes, \u201cCJD, albeit rare, will be more prevalent in the next 5-10 years. Policymakers and health authorities can make use of our findings to establish effective health policies.\u201d"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease-in-japan-trends-show-it-may-not-be-so-rare-70689/", "region": "Asia"},

The products evaluated include a 1% solution of baby shampoo, a neti pot, peroxide sore-mouth cleansers, and mouthwashes.", "The researchers found that several of the nasal and oral rinses had a strong ability to neutralize human coronavirus, which suggests that these products may have the potential to reduce the amount of virus spread by people who are COVID-19-positive.", "\u201cWhile we wait for a vaccine to be developed, methods to reduce transmission are needed,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cThe products we tested are readily available and often already part of people\u2019s daily routines.\u201d", "Meyers and colleagues used a test to replicate the interaction of the virus in the nasal and oral cavities with the rinses and mouthwashes. Nasal and oral cavities are major points of entry and transmission for human coronaviruses. They treated solutions containing a strain of human coronavirus, which served as a readily available and genetically similar alternative for SARS-CoV-2, with the baby shampoo solutions, various peroxide antiseptic rinses and various brands of mouthwash. They allowed the solutions to interact with the virus for 30 seconds, one minute and two minutes, before diluting the solutions to prevent further virus inactivation. According to Meyers, the outer envelopes of the human coronavirus tested and SARS-CoV-2 are genetically similar so the research team hypothesizes that a similar amount of SARS-CoV-2 may be inactivated upon exposure to the solution.", "To measure how much virus was inactivated, the researchers placed the diluted solutions in contact with cultured human cells. They counted how many cells remained alive after a few days of exposure to the viral solution and used that number to calculate the amount of human coronavirus that was inactivated as a result of exposure to the mouthwash or oral rinse that was tested.

Many inactivated greater than 99.9% of virus after only 30 seconds of contact time and some inactivated 99.99% of the virus after 30 seconds.", "According to Meyers, the results with mouthwashes are promising and add to the findings of a study showing that certain types of oral rinses could inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in similar experimental conditions. In addition to evaluating the solutions at longer contact times, they studied over-the-counter products and nasal rinses that were not evaluated in the other study. Meyers said the next step to expand upon these results is to design and conduct clinical trials that evaluate whether products like mouthwashes can effectively reduce viral load in COVID-19-positive patients.", "\u201cPeople who test positive for COVID-19 and return home to quarantine may possibly transmit the virus to those they live with,\u201d said Meyers, a researcher at Penn State Cancer Institute. \u201cCertain professions including dentists and other health care workers are at a constant risk of exposure.

Most commonly affecting children, infection with the bacteria results in stigmatizing and debilitating ulcers. Despite global efforts, yaws remains common in tropical areas in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, affecting millions of people.

But after two years, cases of the disease starting increasing. Molecular testing showed the bacteria were of a single type, however it was unclear if the re-emergence had a single source, or several. In addition, a small proportion of the bacteria were found to be resistant to azithromycin, the first time any such resistance had been seen.", "In this new study, Sanger researchers sequenced the genomes of bacteria from 20 swab samples taken during the follow up of the MDA campaign in Lihir. The aim was to further understand the re-emergence following the MDA and inform future strategies.", "Comparing the DNA sequences of the TPP bacteria, the team constructed phylogenetic \u2018family\u2019 trees to map their evolution. DNA sequences change over time at a constant rate as organisms evolve, and so it is possible to determine the relatedness of individual samples and relate that back to the patient and possible routes of infection. They found that, rather than re-emergence being due to a single source, missed case, or reintroduction, the re-emergence of cases after MDA was actually caused by at least three distinct TPP lineages. The most likely explanation for this is that these were caused by latent infections in people, without symptoms, who didn\u2019t receive the treatment. This has important implications for disease control, leading the researchers to recommend employing strategies to maximize MDA population coverage to reduce the number of people who are missed by these treatments who may have latent infections. They also recommend intensive post-MDA surveillance for detection of \u201cthe last yaws cases\u201d and to control onward transmission of new infections.", "Of the three lineages linked to the re-emergence, one became resistant to azithromycin during the study. To study this antibiotic resistance, the team combined the genomic data with epidemiological data about the movement and interactions of people in the region. This showed that resistance to azithromycin can evolve and spread rapidly in TPP. The authors recommend careful monitoring following an MDA to enable the rapid detection of azithromycin resistance that could compromise MDA campaigns. They also suggest considering alternative treatments for cases detected post-MDA, particularly where diagnostic testing for resistance is unavailable, since resistance is subsequently more likely to be present in the bacterial population.", "Dr Mathew Beale, first author of the study from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: \u201cEven though an impressive 83 per cent of the population were reached with antibiotic treatment initially, there were several instances of re-emergence of the bacteria. The development of antibiotic resistance is worrying, but the fact that it only occurred once after a mass drug administration is positive news. We still need to be very concerned about resistance, but it may be possible to manage it.

In a new study, they describe a vaccine that triggers an immune response against an influenza protein segment that rarely mutates but is normally not targeted by the immune system.", "The vaccine consists of nanoparticles coated with flu proteins that train the immune system to create the desired antibodies. In studies of mice with humanized immune systems, the researchers showed that their vaccine can elicit an antibody response targeting that elusive protein segment, raising the possibility that the vaccine could be effective against any flu strain.", "\u201cThe reason we\u2019re excited about this work is that it is a small step toward developing a flu shot that you just take once, or a few times, and the resulting antibody response is likely to protect against seasonal flu strains and pandemic strains as well,\u201d says Arup K. Chakraborty, the Robert T. Haslam Professor in Chemical Engineering and professor of physics and chemistry at MIT, and a member of MIT\u2019s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard.", "Chakraborty and Daniel Lingwood, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and a group leader at the Ragon Institute, are the senior authors of the study, which appears in\u00a0", ". MIT research scientist Assaf Amitai is the lead author of the paper.", "Targeting flu", "Most flu vaccines consist of inactivated flu viruses. These viruses are coated with a protein called hemagglutinin (HA), which helps them bind to host cells. After vaccination, the immune system generates squadrons of antibodies that target the HA protein. These antibodies almost always bind to the head of the HA protein, which is the part of the protein that mutates the most rapidly. Parts of the HA stem, on the other hand, very rarely mutate.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the complete picture yet, but for many reasons, the immune system is intrinsically not good at seeing the conserved parts of these proteins, which if effectively targeted would elicit an antibody response that would neutralize multiple influenza types,\u201d Lingwood says.", "In their new study, the researchers set out to study why the immune system ends up targeting the HA head rather than the stem, and to find ways to refocus the immune system\u2019s attention on the stem. Such a vaccine could elicit antibodies known as \u201cbroadly neutralizing antibodies,\u201d which would respond to any flu strain. In principle, this kind of vaccine could end the arms race between vaccine designers and rapidly mutating flu viruses.", "One factor that was already known to contribute to antibody preference for the HA head is that HA proteins are densely clustered on the surface of the virus, so it\u2019s difficult for antibodies to access the stem region. The head region is much more accessible.", "The researchers developed a computational model that helped them to further explore the \u201cimmunodominance\u201d of the protein\u2019s head region. \u201cWe hypothesized that the surface geometry of the virus could be key to its ability to survive by protecting its vulnerable parts from antibodies,\u201d Amitai says.", "The researchers explored the effects of geometry on immunodominance using a technique called molecular dynamics simulation. They further modeled a process called antibody affinity maturation. This process, which occurs after B cells encounter a virus (or a vaccine), determines which antibodies will predominate during the immune response.", "Each B cell has on its surface proteins called B cell receptors, which bind to different foreign proteins. Once a particular B cell receptor binds strongly to the HA protein, that B cell becomes activated and starts to multiply rapidly. This process introduces new mutations into the B cell receptors, some of which bind more strongly. These better binders tend to survive, while the weaker binders die. At the end of this process, which takes one or two weeks, there is a population of B cells that is very good at binding strongly to the HA protein. These B cells secrete antibodies that bind to the HA protein.", "\u201cAs time goes on, after infection, the antibodies get better and better at targeting this particular antigen,\u201d Chakraborty says.", "The researchers\u2019 computer simulations of this process revealed that when a typical flu vaccine is given, B cell receptors that bind strongly to the HA stem are at a competitive disadvantage during the maturation process, because they can\u2019t reach their targets as easily as B cell receptors that bind strongly to the HA head.", "The researchers also used their computer model to simulate this maturation process with a nanoparticle vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health, which is now in a phase 1 clinical trial. This particle carries HA stem proteins spaced out at lower density. The model showed that this arrangement makes the proteins more accessible to antibodies, which are Y-shaped, allowing the antibodies to grab onto the proteins with both arms. The simulations revealed that those stem-targeting antibodies predominated at the end of the maturation process.", "Refocused immunity", "The researchers also used their computational model to predict the outcome of several possible vaccination strategies. One strategy that appears promising is to immunize with an HA stem from a virus that is similar to, but not the same as, strains that the recipient has previously been exposed to. In 2009, many people around the world were either infected with or vaccinated against a novel H1N1 strain. The modeling led the researchers to hypothesize that if they vaccinated with nanoparticles displaying HA-like proteins from a strain that is different from the 2009 version, it should elicit the kind of broadly neutralizing antibodies that may confer universal immunity.", "Using mice with human immune cells, the researchers tested this strategy, first immunizing them against the 2009 H1N1 strain, followed by a nanoparticle vaccine carrying the HA stem protein from a different H1N1 strain. They found that this approach was much more successful at eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies than any of the other strategies that they tested.", "\u201cWe discovered that this particular event in our immune history can actually be harnessed with this particular nanoparticle to refocus the immune system\u2019s attention on one of these so-called universal vaccine targets,\u201d Lingwood says. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a refocusing event, that means we can swing the antibody response against that target, which under other conditions is simply not seen. We have shown in previous studies that when you\u2019re able to elicit this kind of response, it\u2019s protective against flu strains that mimic pandemic threats.\u201d", "\n"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/mit-researchers-working-on-universal-flu-vaccine-70502/", "region": "Vaccines"},

In the case of flaviviruses, however, if a person gets a second flavivirus infection \u2013 they were originally infected with Zika and then got dengue, for instance \u2013 the presence of antibodies can result in more severe symptoms through a process called antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.", "\u201cIf, at some point in the past you\u2019ve had Zika virus, later when you are exposed to dengue, you are at much greater risk of getting sick. Antibodies created by memory B cells as a result of the Zika infection can bind to certain parts of the dengue virus, but the dengue virus isn\u2019t affected,\u201d said Deepta Bhattacharya, PhD, an associate professor in the UArizona College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson\u2019s Department of Immunobiology. \u201cIn fact, the memory B cell-generated antibodies can work like a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 and help the virus get into the cells, where it can make the disease worse.\u201d", "The findings give Dr. Bhattacharya and his team a new way to think about creating flavivirus vaccines.

For most viral pathogens, like influenza or SARS-CoV-2, this is a good thing. It means that memory B cells are poised to make new antibodies and deal with mutations if and when they arise,\u201d Dr. Bhattacharya said. \u201cFor flaviviruses, this is not so great. We found that memory B cells produce a lot of suboptimal antibodies that could enhance the second infection.\u201d", "Although memory B cells recognize the new virus as a flavivirus and produce antibodies, those antibodies are unable to stop the new virus from infecting cells.

These tests are highly sensitive \u2013 capable of detecting very low viral RNA levels \u2013 and are optimal for the early detection of the virus. The performance of these tests depends on the time the sample is collected, with viral load declining after the first week of symptoms. By contrast, antibody tests can determine whether someone has had the virus in the past. For diagnosis later in disease, or in delayed-onset syndromes, antibody tests could form an important part of hospital diagnostic capabilities. In the new study, the researchers developed their own sensitive and specific antibody assay and used it to conduct unbiased, head-to-head comparisons of ten commercial antibody test kits on an identical panel of 110 SARS-CoV-2-positive blood samples from patients admitted to hospitals with COVID-19 and 50 pre-pandemic negatives.", "There was a broad range of performance among the tests, with specificity \u2014 the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate) \u2014 ranging from 82% to 100%, and overall sensitivity \u2014 the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate) \u2013 ranging from 60.9% to 87.3%.

We really need better treatments for influenza B. I\u2019m hopeful that these antibodies, which neutralized every strain of influenza B that we tested, could be developed into drugs to treat patients with severe influenza B infection.\u201d", "Nearly all influenza viruses that sicken people can be classified into one of two groups: A and B. The most widely used flu medication \u2014 Tamiflu \u2014 is approved to treat both kinds, but the drug is less effective for influenza B.", "Influenza B is the less common of the two and tends to show up late in the flu season, but, for unclear reasons, children are particularly vulnerable to it. During the 2019-20 flu season, 187 children in the U.S. died of influenza, nearly two-thirds from influenza B, making it the worst flu season for children in a decade. In comparison, between 24,000 and 62,000 adults also died of flu during the 2019-20 season, but about a quarter of the adult deaths were due to influenza B.", "Last year, Ellebedy\u2019s group identified an antibody called 1G01 that protects mice from the flu by jamming up a critical viral enzyme known as neuraminidase. Both influenza A and influenza B viruses use the enzyme to cut themselves free from cells so they can go on and infect more cells. When neuraminidase is out of order, viral reproduction grinds to a halt. The antibody they found last year inactivated neuraminidases from a wide range of influenza A viruses and some influenza B viruses.", "\u201cThat antibody recognized neuraminidases from the older influenza B strains, but it didn\u2019t recognize the enzyme from the influenza B strains that are circulating now,\u201d Ellebedy said. \u201cIf we tried to make a drug based on that antibody alone, it wouldn\u2019t work for most people with influenza caused by influenza B viruses. So we decided to look for antibodies that are broadly protective against influenza B viruses with the idea that we would combine them with the earlier antibody that protects against influenza A to get a broad-spectrum antiviral for influenza.\u201d", "Co-author Philip A. Mudd, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of emergency medicine, and the clinical sample collection team in the Washington University Emergency Care and Research Core obtained consent to take blood samples from a patient hospitalized with influenza B virus infection. Ellebedy and colleagues separated out antibody-producing cells from the patient\u2019s blood. The research team included co-senior authors Florian Krammer, PhD, a microbiology professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Daved Fremont, PhD, a professor of pathology and immunology at Washington University; and co-first authors Anders Madsen, PhD, of the University of Bergen in Norway; Ya-Nan Dai, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Fremont\u2019s lab at Washington University; and Meagan McMahon, PhD, a research assistant professor at Mount Sinai.", "The researchers then generated antibodies from the cells and analyzed them. They found seven different antibodies that targeted neuraminidase. Two of the antibodies \u2014 1G05 and 2E01 \u2014 potently inhibited all neuraminidases from a diverse set of nine influenza B viruses.", "Further, the two antibodies protected mice against a lethal dose of influenza B virus. The researchers infected groups of five mice with influenza B virus, and then treated them three days later with one of the two antibodies or a placebo antibody. The animals became sick and lost weight, but all of the mice treated with 2E01 and four of the five mice treated with 1G05 survived. In comparison, all the mice that received a placebo antibody died.", "\u201cGiven their potency, I think these antibodies against influenza B \u2013 especially when combined with the antibody against influenza A \u2013 could form the basis for a new and more effective treatment for influenza virus infections, especially in children,\u201d Krammer said.", "Further experiments conducted by Dai showed that, like the influenza A antibody previously identified, the two influenza B antibodies neutralized neuraminidase by clogging up the part of the enzyme that cuts the virus loose from cells. Structural analysis of the interactions between the antibodies and the neuraminidases, though, showed that each antibody interfered in a slightly different way, meaning that it would be especially hard for the virus to evolve drug resistance to both of them at once.", "\u201cThere\u2019s a piece of the antibodies that gets down deep into the enzyme\u2019s active site and prevents it from cutting by interfering at multiple spots,\u201d Fremont said. \u201cIt is hard to see how you could mutate this site in such a way that the antibodies no longer interfere but the site still functions. It\u2019s really a no-win situation for the virus, which is good for us.\u201d", "Dai added: \u201cThere are some strains of influenza virus that have mutations that make them resistant to Tamiflu. We tested two of those resistant strains, and our antibodies inhibited both of them, so we think that these antibodies might be even more broadly protective than Tamiflu.\u201d", "The researchers are in discussions with potential partners to begin the process of developing the antibodies into a drug for influenza.

Aside from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has currently taken the spotlight, the zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses have also become major threats to human health in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical countries. All three viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and cause diseases that have similar symptoms, making early diagnosis particularly difficult without complex molecular diagnostic equipment.", "In a recent effort to make the diagnosis of these mosquito-borne diseases faster and easier, a team of scientists, led by Professor Min-Gon Kim from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in Korea, have developed a compact, fully automatic, and inexpensive tool that can identify the presence of these viruses from a blood serum sample.

This helps teach the immune system to recognise and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus. To form a powerful immune response against SARS-CoV-2, it is important that a booster vaccination is provided. However, booster vaccinations that use the same adenovirus vector might not produce an effective response, because the immune system may recognise and attack the vector. This would block the vaccine from entering people\u2019s cells and teaching the body to recognise and attack SARS-CoV-2. For our vaccine, we use two different adenovirus vectors in a bid to avoid the immune system becoming immune to the vector.\u201d", "The trials took place in two hospitals in Russia. The trials were open-label and non-randomised, meaning that participants knew that they were receiving the vaccine and were not assigned by chance to different treatment groups.", "The trials involved healthy adults aged 18-60 years, who self-isolated as soon as they were registered for the trial and remained in hospital for the first 28 days of the trial (from when they were first vaccinated).", "The frozen vaccine (Gam-COVID-Vac) was trialled in a branch of Burdenko Hospital, an agency of the Ministry of Defence, and involved both civilian and military volunteers.

In the phase 2, which began no earlier than five days after the phase 1 trial began, participants received the full two-part vaccine (they received a prime vaccination with the rAd26-S component on day 0, followed by a booster vaccination with rAd5-S component on day 21. There were 20 participants each in the frozen and freeze-dried vaccine groups).", "The trial was designed to study the number of adverse events of the vaccines (safety), and the antibody response elicited by the vaccines (immunogenicity). Secondary outcome measures of the trials included the neutralising antibody response and the T cell response elicited. To compare post-vaccination immunity with natural immunity formed by infection with SARS-CoV-2, the authors obtained convalescent plasma from 4,817 people who had recovered from mild or moderate COVID-19.", "\n", "Both vaccine formulations were safe over the 42-day study period and well tolerated.

The authors note that these adverse effects are characteristic of those seen with other vaccines, particularly those based on recombinant viral vectors.", "All participants in the phase 2 trials (40 participants) produced antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein \u2013 with levels of antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (geometric mean titres of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-specific IgG) at 14,703 for the frozen formulation, and at 11,143 for the freeze-dried formulation on day 42 of the trial.", "In addition, neutralising antibody responses occurred in all 40 participants in the phase 2 trials by day 42 (geometric mean titre levels of 49.25 with the frozen formulation and 45.95 with the freeze-dried formulation at day 42), whereas neutralising antibody responses were only found in 61% of participants in the phase 1 study who only received rAd26-S (combined data for both the lyophilised and frozen vaccine formulations).", "Comparing the antibody responses from the vaccination and from infection (using the convalescent plasma samples), the authors say that the antibody responses from vaccination appear to be higher in people vaccinated. Vaccination also elicited the same level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies as in people who had recovered from COVID-19.", "T cell responses occurred in all participants in the phase 2 trials within 28 days of vaccination \u2013 including formation of T-helper (CD4) cells and T-killer (CD8) cells. The number of T-helper cells increased by 2.5% and the number of T-killer cells increased by 1.3% after vaccination with the frozen formulation, and by 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively, after vaccination with the freeze-dried formulation.", "The authors say that despite there being neutralising antibody responses against the adenovirus vectors, the antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was not affected. In addition, the neutralising antibodies against rAd26 did not interfere with rAd5, or vice versa. They say that this suggests that using different adenovirus vectors is an effective approach to elicit a robust immune response and to overcome the immune reaction to the first viral vector, but note that more research will be needed to confirm this.", "The authors note some limitations to their study, including that it had a short follow-up (42 days), it was a small study, some parts of the phase 1 trials included only male volunteers, and there was no placebo or control vaccine. In addition, they note that despite planning to recruit healthy volunteers aged 18-60 years, in general, their study included fairly young volunteers (in their 20s and 30s, on average).", "They say that more research is needed to evaluate the vaccine in different populations, including older age groups, individuals with underlying medical conditions, and people in at-risk groups.", "Explaining the next steps of their research, Professor Alexander Gintsburg, N F Gamaleya National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia, says: \u201cUnprecedented measures have been taken to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in Russia. Preclinical and clinical studies have been done, which has made it possible to provisionally approve the vaccine under the current Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of April 3, 2020 no 441. This provisional licensure requires a large-scale study, allows vaccination in a consented general population in the context of a phase 3 trial, allows the vaccine to be brought into use in a population under strict pharmacovigilance, and to provide vaccination of risk groups.\u201d", "\u201cThe phase 3 clinical trial of our vaccine was approved on 26 August 2020. It is planned to include 40,000 volunteers from different age and risk groups, and will be undertaken with constant monitoring of volunteers through an online application.\u201d", "Writing in a linked Comment, lead author Dr Naor Bar-Zeev, International Vaccine Access Center, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, USA (who was not involved in the study), says: \u201cSimilar to these studies before it, Logunov and colleagues\u2019 studies are encouraging but small. The immunogenicity bodes well, although nothing can be inferred on immunogenicity in older age groups, and clinical efficacy for any COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been shown\u2026 Showing safety will be crucial with COVID-19 vaccines, not only for vaccine acceptance but also for trust in vaccination broadly. Safety outcomes up to now are reassuring, but studies to date are too small to address less common or rare serious adverse events. Unlike clinical trials of therapeutics, in which safety is balanced against benefit in patients, vaccine trials have to balance safety against infection risk, not against disease outcome. Since vaccines are given to healthy people and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially to everyone after approval following phase 3 trials, safety is paramount\u2026\u201d", "\u201cLicensure in most settings should depend on proven short-term and long-term efficacy against disease (not just immunogenicity) and more complete safety data\u2026 Safety assurance will then require further large-scale surveillance after licensure. Such surveillance is not well established in many settings, and rapid efforts need to be made by governments, regulators, and global research funders to get those systems in place. Surveillance will also be vital for showing transmission reduction, which is to come from phase 3 trials since these are powered to detect COVID-19 disease outcomes and not asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection\u2026\u201d", "\u201cTo be sure, most past vaccines were designed to target disease and not infection as such, but with COVID-19, the general public could be expecting striking reductions in disease transmission after widespread vaccine introduction. Such effects would be very welcome if they occur, but they are far from certain. A vaccine that reduces disease but does not prevent infection might paradoxically make things worse. It could falsely reassure recipients of personal invulnerability, thus reducing transmission mitigating behaviours. In turn, this could lead to increased exposure among older adults in whom efficacy is likely to be lower, or among other higher-risk groups who might have lower vaccine acceptance and uptake\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIn view of the ongoing painful toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and its magnitude, the more vaccine candidates that have successful early results the better. Ultimately, all vaccine candidates will need to show safety and prove durable clinical efficacy (including in groups at greater risk) in large randomised trials before they can be put into widespread use. Equitable access will require multiple vaccine producers and providers in a range of settings. Each of their successes will together lead us towards our collective, longed for, new day.\u201d"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/russia-coronavirus-vaccine-trials-no-serious-adverse-events-and-elicit-antibody-response-42561/", "region": "Research"},

The front part \u2014 the barrier component \u2014 contains the filtration material and is contoured to fit tightly while allowing space ahead of the nose and mouth to avoid breathing restrictions and permit unrestricted speech. Made from the kind of moisture-wicking material used in athletic clothing, it includes a pocket into which a filter can be inserted to increase the filtration efficiency and thereby increase protection. The washable fabric filter is made of a blend of Spandex and polyester.", "The second part of the mask is fashioned from stretchable material. The stretchable part, which has holes for the ears to help position the mask, holds the front portion in place and fastens with conventional hook and eyelet hardware, a mechanism that has been used in clothing for centuries.", "\u201cWe want people to be able to get the mask in the right place every time,\u201d Jayaraman said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t position it correctly and easily, you are going to have to keep fiddling with it. We see that all the time on television with people adjusting their masks and letting them drop below their noses.\u201d", "\n", "Beyond controlling air leakage, designing a better mask involves a tradeoff between filtration effectiveness and how well users can breathe. If a mask makes breathing too difficult, users will simply not use it, reducing compliance with masking requirements.", "Many existing mask designs attempt to increase filtration effectiveness by boosting the number of layers, but that may not be as helpful as it might seem, Park said. \u201cWe tested 16 layers of handkerchief material, and as we increased the layers, we measured increased breathing resistance,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile the breathing resistance went up, the filtration did not improve as much as we would have expected.\u201d", "\u201cGood filtration efficiency is not enough by itself,\u201d said Jayaraman. \u201cThe combination of fit, filtration efficiency, and staying in the right place make for a good mask.\u201d", "The stretchable part of the mask is made from knitted fabric \u2014 a Spandex/Lyocell blend \u2014 to allow for stretching around the head and under the chin. The researchers used a woven elastic band sewn with pleats to cover the top of the nose.", "The researchers made their mask prototypes from synthetic materials instead of cotton. Though cotton is a natural material, it absorbs moisture and holds it on the face, reducing breathability, and potentially creating a \u201cpetri dish\u201d for the growth of microbes.", "\n", "\u201cMasks have become an essential accessory in our wardrobe and add a social dimension to how we feel about wearing them,\u201d Park said. So, the materials chosen for the mask come in a variety of colors and designs. \u201cIntegrating form and function is key to having a mask that protects individuals while making them look good and feel less self-conscious,\u201d Jayaraman said.", "The work of Jayaraman and Park didn\u2019t begin with the Covid-19 pandemic. They received funding 10 years ago from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study face masks during the avian influenza outbreak. Since then Jayaraman has been part of several National Academy of Medicine initiatives to develop recommendations for improved respiratory protection.", "Covid-19 dramatically increased the importance of using face masks because of the role played by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic exposure from persons who don\u2019t know they are infected, Jayaraman said.

The virus is captured through a swab inside the nostrils and at the back of the throat. However, it can take as long as 14 days for an individual to show symptoms of COVID-19, by which time the virus may have moved away from the nose and throat and into the lungs and other tissues and organs, making it harder to detect via a swab test. As a result, studies have shown that PCR tests can miss as many as a half of infected patients five days after infection.", "Antibody tests provide an alternative way of identifying infected individuals, but antibodies \u2013 molecules produced by our immune system in response to infection \u2013 generally do not appear until at least six days after infection.", "Professor Ravi Gupta from the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Cambridge said: \u201cWe still do not have a gold standard test for diagnosing COVID-19.

Over the course of the study, the hospitals where these children stayed continued to test them every three days on average, providing a picture of how long viral shedding continues over time.", "The study\u2019s findings show that the duration of symptoms varied widely, from three days to nearly three weeks. There was also a significant spread in how long children continued to shed virus and could be potentially infectious. While the virus was detectable for an average of about two-and-a-half weeks in the entire group, a significant portion of the children \u2014 about a fifth of the asymptomatic patients and about half of the symptomatic ones \u2014 were still shedding virus at the three week mark.", "Drs. DeBiasi and Delaney write in their commentary that the study makes several important points that add to the knowledge base about COVID-19 in children. One of these is the large number of asymptomatic patients \u2014 about a fifth of the group followed in this study. Another is that children, a group widely thought to develop mostly mild disease that quickly passes, can retain symptoms for weeks. A third and important point, they say, is the duration of viral shedding. Even asymptomatic children continued to shed virus for a long time after initial testing, making them potential key vectors.", "However, the commentary authors say, despite these important findings, the study raises several questions. One concerns the link between testing and transmission. A qualitative \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d on testing platforms may not necessarily reflect infectivity, with some positives reflecting bits of genetic material that may not be able to make someone sick or negatives reflecting low levels of virus that may still be infectious.", "Testing reliability may be further limited by the testers themselves, with sampling along different portions of the respiratory tract or even by different staff members leading to different laboratory results. It\u2019s also unknown whether asymptomatic individuals are shedding different quantities of virus than those with symptoms, a drawback of the qualitative testing performed by most labs. Further, testing only for active virus instead of antibodies ignores the vast number of individuals who may have had and cleared an asymptomatic or mild infection, an important factor for understanding herd immunity.", "Lastly, Drs. DeBiasi and Delaney point out, the study only tested for viral shedding from the respiratory tract even though multiple studies have detected the virus in other bodily fluids, including stool. It\u2019s unknown what role these other sources might play in the spread of this disease.", "Drs. DeBiasi and Delaney note that each of these findings and additional questions could affect public health efforts continually being developed and refined to bring COVID-19 under control in the U.S. and around the world. Children\u2019s National has added their own research to these efforts, with ongoing studies to assess how SARS-CoV-2 infections proceed in children, including how antibodies develop both at the individual and population level.", "\u201cEach of these pieces of information that we, our collaborators and other scientists around the world are working to gather,\u201d says Dr. DeBiasi, \u201cis critical for developing policies that will slow the rate of viral transmission in our community.\u201d"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/covid-19-asymptomatic-children-can-shed-sars-cov-2-for-weeks-52986/", "region": "Research"},

However, after a person has been infected with two types of dengue viruses, they usually gain some degree of immune protection against future dengue disease severity.", "When Zika first emerged in Latin America in late 2015, many speculated whether the flavivirus, a close cousin to the dengue viruses, might interact with the dengue viruses in a similar way.", "\u201cThe first question was, \u2018How will prior dengue virus infection affect Zika?\u2019 because everyone in Latin America, to some degree or another, is eventually dengue immune and has dengue antibodies,\u201d said study senior author Eva Harris, a professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley.", "Since 2004, Harris and her colleagues in Nicaragua have monitored a cohort of approximately 3,800 children living in Managua, the country\u2019s capital, tracking any signs of dengue disease and collecting annual blood samples to test for the virus and its antibodies.

But the inverse question, whether Zika antibodies protect against future dengue disease, or potentially enhance it, remained a mystery.", "Landing amidst an outbreak", "In July 2019, Harris landed in Managua with Katzelnick, who would be stationed in Nicaragua\u2019s capital for the rest of the year as a Fogarty Global Health Fellow. The two arrived at the very beginning of what would become a massive epidemic of dengue virus Type 2, one of the more severe of the four flavors, or serotypes, of dengue, and the first major outbreak of dengue since the Zika epidemic in 2016.", "\u201cWe watched as the epidemic spread in real time, and we started thinking, you know what, there are a lot of cases. I wonder if previous infection with Zika is pushing people into symptomatic disease?'\u201d Harris said.", "The team gathered data from its pediatric cohort and from another study of children being treated at a nearby pediatric hospital. By mid-autumn, the researchers had enough evidence to prove that having a prior Zika infection made a person more likely to have a symptomatic dengue infection. And as cases mounted, they found that prior Zika infection can also enhance dengue disease severity.", "The team drew on the pediatric cohort\u2019s bank of blood samples going back to 2004 to investigate other patterns of disease. It found that people who had one dengue infection, followed by a Zika infection, remained at high risk of developing a second, more severe dengue infection. In addition, when a person had two sequential dengue infections, the type of dengue virus that caused the second infection impacted whether the person was protected or experienced enhanced dengue disease.", "\u201cI think this can really help us understand epidemics that are coming down the line,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo, for instance, if you have a dengue Type 2 epidemic after a big Zika outbreak, you know to prepare your hospitals to treat people who might be more likely to develop a more severe disease.\u201d", "When immunity backfires", "When we get sick, our bodies produce large proteins called antibodies to help our immune system fight the infection. These antibodies have specific chemical shapes that allow them to stick to the pathogen of concern, flagging the invader to be broken down by immune cells. For viruses like Zika and dengue, they also can coat the virus and prevent it from entering the body\u2019s cells, effectively neutralizing it.", "Antibody-dependent enhancement can happen when an antibody designed to stick to one virus, like Zika, tries to stick to a slightly different virus, like dengue. Antibodies to Zika virus can attach to dengue viruses, but not quite well enough to neutralize them. As a result, when a passing immune cell senses the antibody \u201cflag\u201d and tries to break down the dengue virus, it can actually end up getting infected by the virus.", "\u201cThis mechanism not only allows the virus to get into more cells to infect, but also suppresses the immune response of those cells, enabling the virus to produce even more virus,\u201d Katzelnick said. \u201cAnd, because they\u2019re immune cells, they are moving around the body. And so, they can initiate a larger infection.\u201d", "In a 2017 study, Katzelnick, Harris and the team in Nicaragua showed that infection with one dengue virus can lead to a more severe infection with a second dengue virus through antibody-dependent enhancement.", "Though this mechanism has complicated the search for effective vaccines for both Zika and dengue, Katzelnick and Harris say that it is still possible to design vaccines that spur the body to create antibodies that only stick to the targeted virus, and no other.", "\u201cZika is still a horrible problem that has a lot of complicated ethical considerations, in part because of the way it affects pregnant women and also potentially their children,\u201d Katzelnick said. \u201cI really hope that people keep working very hard to find ways to develop a safe vaccine, even if it\u2019s more challenging than we originally thought.\u201d", "\n"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/people-with-antibodies-to-zika-virus-are-more-vulnerable-to-severe-infection-with-certain-types-of-dengue-38199/", "region": "Research"},

There are still no methods to treat nor prevent HHV-6B infection, and this study represents the first attempt in the world at developing a vaccine.", "The results were published online in the American scientific journal ", "on July 23.", "Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) is passed on to infants via the saliva of family members etc., causing exanthem subitum which has symptoms of a fever over 38\u00b0C followed by a rash all over the body (roseola). The overwhelming majority of people are infected with HHV-6B. The infection period is between 6 months and 2 years of age; this coincides with the diminishment of antibodies received from the mother.", "In most cases, infants recover without experiencing any serious symptoms, however severe complications can occur. For example, it has been reported that in Japan, around 150 infants a year suffer encephalitis or encephalopathy, resulting in lasting aftereffects in around half of this number. Therefore, it is essential to develop a vaccine to protect infants from HHV-6B infection, as there is currently no established treatment nor preventative measures against the virus.", "Previously, Professor Mori\u2019s research group discovered the glycoprotein complex gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2, which is expressed on the HHV-6B virus\u2019s surface. They also revealed that the interaction between this complex and CD314 (OX40), which is expressed on stimulated T-cells, is the key to infection (Figure 1). An antibody that targets the gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex would be able to prevent HHV-6B infection. Therefore, the group is also conducting research into generating antibodies that can be used on humans from mice antibodies.", "From this accumulated knowledge and experience came the following idea: an efficient immune response against HHV-6B infection could be achieved if inoculation with the gH/gl/gQ1/gQ2 complex induced immunity against the complex.", "The researchers developed a vaccine based on the HHV-6B gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex. (A Patent Application for the vaccine has been filed by the BIKEN Foundation and Kobe University (Patent Application No. 2017-509816)). They generated the gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex via genetic modification techniques. This complex was utilized as the vaccine antigen and mice were inoculated with this in combination with an adjuvant, and immunity induction was analyzed .", "The HHV-6B gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex is a complicated molecule constructed in a cell with four types of protein. A method was developed to grow this complex in a cultivated cell in which all the proteins are expressed at the same time. It was confirmed that the HHV-6B gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complexes generated using this method still retained their function of binding to their target receptor molecule, CD134 (OX40).", "The complex was combined with the adjuvant aluminum hydroxide (abbreviated to Alum), which is widely used in current vaccines, and administered to mice in several doses. The immune response was analyzed; the results confirmed there were vaccine induced antibodies against the gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex in the serum of the mice, and their serum had actually prevented HHV-6B from infecting the cells. Furthermore, it was shown that the glycoprotein complex itself had activated dendritic cells, inducing innate immunity.", "Furthermore, a vaccine with a combination of oligonucleotide D35 (which can induce cellular immunity) and its transporter, the DOTAP lipid, as adjuvants in addition to Alum was developed. This vaccine was demonstrated to induce an even stronger antibody response. Spleen cells were extracted from mice after the immunity experiments and the immune cell responses to the gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex were investigated. The results showed a stronger response to the antigen in the group inoculated with the Alum/D35/DOTAP combination and confirmed that cellular immunity was induced. Additional analysis results revealed that CD4 T-cells were the main responders to the antigen.", "The researchers also investigated whether or not the induction of serum antibodies via inoculation with the gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex actually prevented HHV-6B infection in animals (Figure 3). This experiment utilized immune cell-humanized mice (*5) to develop an animal model of HHV-6B infection. As a negative control, humanized mice were administered with serum from mice that had been given a vaccine containing only the adjuvant. The humanized mice were then injected with HHV-6B. The virus proliferated internally and many virus antigens were detected in the spleens of the negative control group.", "On the other hand, the virus did not proliferate in humanized mice that received prior administration of serum from mice who were inoculated with the vaccine containing the gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex. Also, there were hardly any virus antigens in the spleens of these humanized mice. This demonstrates that the induced immunity from the vaccine is efficient against HHV-6B infection in mice.", "Effective treatment and preventative methods for HHV-6B infection have yet to be established despite the latent risks that it poses to the health of all infants. The results of this research represent a huge step towards the efficient prevention of HHV-6B infection with a vaccine. It was demonstrated that this vaccine, which used the gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 complex as an antigen, efficiently induced an immune system response. Also, the vaccine is promising from a safety aspect as it is a subunit vaccine (*6) that does not contain other virus-derived molecules, aside from the complex. Currently, many infants are given a combined inoculation against four diseases called the DPT-IPV vaccine (D: Diphtheria, P: pertussis, T: tetanus and IPV: inactivated polio virus) at 3 months of age. It is hoped that HHV-6B inoculation could be added to this vaccine to prevent infants from contracting it.", "After infection, HHV-6B remains latent inside its host for their entire life. It can be reactivated by conditions such as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome or a decline in immunity, and has been reported to trigger various illnesses. In particular, this as a problem when hematopoietic stem cell transplants are used to treat leukemia, leading to a high frequency of HHV-6B reactivation which can cause life-threatening encephalitis.

In a study of 192 children ages 0-22, 49 children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and an additional 18 children had late-onset, COVID-19-related illness. The infected children were shown to have a significantly higher level of virus in their airways than hospitalized adults in ICUs for COVID-19 treatment.", "\u201cI was surprised by the high levels of virus we found in children of all ages, especially in the first two days of infection,\u201d says Lael Yonker, MD, director of the MGH Cystic Fibrosis Center and lead author of the study, \u201cPediatric SARS-CoV-2: Clinical Presentation, Infectivity, and Immune Reponses,\u201d published in the\u00a0", ". \u201cI was not expecting the viral load to be so high. You think of a hospital, and of all of the precautions taken to treat severely ill adults, but the viral loads of these hospitalized patients are significantly lower than a \u2018healthy child\u2019 who is walking around with a high SARS-CoV-2 viral load.\u201d", "Transmissibility or risk of contagion is greater with a high viral load. And even when children exhibit symptoms typical of COVID-19, like fever, runny nose and cough, they often overlap with common childhood illnesses, including influenza and the common cold. This confounds an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, the illness derived from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, says Yonker. Along with viral load, researchers examined expression of the viral receptor and antibody response in healthy children, children with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and a smaller number of children with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).", "Findings from nose and throat swabs and blood samples from the MGHfC Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository carry implications for the reopening of schools, daycare centers and other locations with a high density of children and close interaction with teachers and staff members. \u201cKids are not immune from this infection, and their symptoms don\u2019t correlate with exposure and infection,\u201d says Alessio Fasano, MD, director of the Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center at MGH and senior author of the manuscript. \u201cDuring this COVID-19 pandemic, we have mainly screened symptomatic subjects, so we have reached the erroneous conclusion that the vast majority of people infected are adults. However, our results show that kids are not protected against this virus. We should not discount children as potential spreaders for this virus.\u201d", "The researchers note that although children with COVID-19 are not as likely to become as seriously ill as adults, as asymptomatic carriers or carriers with few symptoms attending school, they can spread infection and bring the virus into their homes. This is a particular concern for families in certain socio-economic groups, which have been harder hit in the pandemic, and multi-generational families with vulnerable older adults in the same household. In the MGHfC study, 51 percent of children with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection came from low-income communities compared to 2 percent from high-income communities.", "In another breakthrough finding from the study, the researchers challenge the current hypothesis that because children have lower numbers of immune receptors for SARS-CoV2, this makes them less likely to become infected or seriously ill. Data from the group show that although younger children have lower numbers of the virus receptor than older children and adults, this does not correlate with a decreased viral load. According to the authors, this finding suggests that children can carry a high viral load, meaning they are more contagious, regardless of their susceptibility to developing COVID-19 infection.", "The researchers also studied immune response in MIS-C, a multi-organ, systemic infection that can develop in children with COVID-19 several weeks after infection. Complications from the accelerated immune response seen in MIS-C can include severe cardiac problems, shock and acute heart failure. \u201cThis is a severe complication as a result of the immune response to COVID-19 infection, and the number of these patients is growing,\u201d says Fasano, who is also a professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School (HMS). \u201cAnd, as in adults with these very serious systemic complications, the heart seems to be the favorite organ targeted by post-COVID-19 immune response,\u201d adds Fasano.", "Understanding MIS-C and post-infectious immune responses from pediatric COVID-19 patients is critical for developing next steps in treatment and prevention strategies, according to the researchers. Early insights into the immune dysfunction in MIS-C should prompt caution when developing vaccine strategies, notes Yonker.", "As MGHfC pediatricians, both Yonker and Fasano are constantly fielding questions from parents about the safe return of their children to school and daycare. They agree that the most critical question is what steps the schools will implement \u201cto keep the kids, teachers, and personnel safe.\u201d Recommendations from their study, which includes 30 co-authors from MGHfC, MGH, HMS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, include not relying on body temperature or symptom monitoring to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection in the school setting.", "The researchers emphasize infection control measures, including social distancing, universal mask use (when implementable), effective hand-washing protocols and a combination of remote and in-person learning. They consider routine and continued screening of all students for SARS-CoV-2 infection with timely reporting of the results an imperative part of a safe return-to-school policy.", "\u201cThis study provides much-needed facts for policymakers to make the best decisions possible for schools, daycare centers and other institutions that serve children,\u201d says Fasano. \u201cKids are a possible source of spreading this virus, and this should be taken into account in the planning stages for reopening schools.\u201d", "Fasano fears that a hurried return to school without proper planning could result in an uptick in cases of COVID-19 infections. \u201cIf schools were to reopen fully without necessary precautions, it is likely that children will play a larger role in this pandemic,\u201d the authors conclude."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/massachusetts-general-hospital-researchers-show-children-are-silent-spreaders-of-sars-cov-2-49362/", "region": "Research"},

But they were in for another surprise.

Anecdotal reports in the early stages of the pandemic showed these patients were not getting COVID-19. Earlier researchers then explored HCQ in the lab and found it effective against the virus, in addition to its already established anti-inflammatory properties, so testing in people for prevention or treatment at first held some promise. Since those early tests, various more recent studies have shown that HCQ is not effective in treating moderate-to-severe hospitalized cases. Treatment with HCQ early in the disease or for mild cases is still under review.", "\u201cOur study shows, with a large degree of confidence, that HCQ is ineffective as a preventive antiviral in people with SLE and/or RA taking drugs that suppress their immune system, putting them at greater risk,\u201d said Mendel Singer, PhD, MPH, lead author and associate professor and vice chair for education in the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. \u201cGiven how the study was structured, one can make an educated extension that it is not effective in preventing COVID-19 in people without those conditions.

Prior studies had fewer than 20 COVID-19 patients with SLE and/or RA; this study had 159. This study showed that patients with SLE and/or RA who contracted COVID-19 were just as likely to be taking HCQ as SLE and/or RA patients who did not get COVID-19.", "\u201cBy drawing on data from a relatively large patient population with lupus and/or RA, we can offer a higher level of confidence in our findings,\u201d said Singer. \u201cWe see from this large retrospective review that this drug is ineffective in preventing COVID-19 in these patients who have been taking HCQ. If HCQ were effective in prevention, we would have seen fewer HCQ-taking SLE/RA patients with COVID-19, but did not. This likely means that HCQ is not active against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in humans\u2013versus in the lab\u2013and is unlikely to be an effective preventive antiviral for anyone.\u201d", "\n"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/hydroxychloroquine-ineffective-as-a-preventive-antiviral-against-covid-19-case-western-reserve-university-study-34765/", "region": "Research"},

{"title": "\r\n        Hepatitis D drug, Hepcludex, receives approval by the European Commission        ", "date": "August 5, 2020", "body": ["What started off as basic research 25 years ago has now lead to a successfully approved drug: The entry blocker bulevirtide (brand name Hepcludex, formerly known as Myrcludex B), jointly developed by researchers from Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD) and the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg, the DZIF and other partners, has now been approved by the European Commission. Hepcludex is a first-in-class entry inhibitor for the treatment of hepatitis D and prevents hepatitis D and B viruses (HDV/HBV) from entering liver cells. The development of this new drug brings new hope to approximately 25 million people in the world suffering from hepatitis D infection, as no other approved drug has been available to treat this infectious disease up to now. Hepatitis D virus infections are a particularly severe form of viral hepatitis as they only occur as co-infections with HBV and lead to an accelerated progression of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. To date, liver transplants have been the only chance of survival for many patients.", "\u201cWe are very pleased about this success which is based on decades of virology research in Heidelberg,\u201d notes Prof. Hans-Georg Kr\u00e4usslich, spokesman of the Center of Infectious Disease Research at the UKHD and Chairman of the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF). \u201cThis drug was developed in close collaboration between partners in science, public funders and a biotech company and is therefore an epitome of successful translation of laboratory results into clinical application.\u201d", "Hepcludex\u2019s mechanism of action is based on a lock-and-key principle: Hepatitis B and D viruses exclusively replicate in the liver as they require the bile acid transporter NTCP to do so, which is only found on liver cells. They use this transporter like the \u2018lock\u2019 (virus receptor) through which they enter the cell. Hepcludex blocks this lock, acting like a broken key that is stuck in the lock. However, Hepcludex also works after an infection has occurred and the virus has already entered the cell, why is this so? \u201cThe virus continually needs to infect healthy liver cells in order to persist, as the infected ones either die or are eliminated by the immune system,\u201d says Prof. Stephan Urban. Over the course of 25 years of research, Urban and his team developed Hepcludex and, since his appointment as a DZIF professor in 2014, have focussed on developing the drug. \u201cLiver cells evidently divide very rapidly when the liver is infected. The drug then protects the new, regenerated liver cells from infection whilst the infected cells are eliminated,\u201d explains Stephan Urban. Several phase I and II clinical trials showed that humans tolerate the agent well and that it efficiently prevents the replication of hepatitis B and D viruses. A phase III trial is currently being conducted, investigating Hepcludex\u2019s long-term effects, amongst other things.", "The research was initially funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), which provided 2.4 million euros for the preclinical development through the funding programme \u201cInnovative Therapies\u201d. As of 2014, the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), which was founded in 2012, joined in and has been financing Stephan Urban\u2019s professorship at the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg, amongst other projects.", "When molecular biologist Stephan Urban started his research in a small laboratory, he did not have the development of a drug for hepatitis D in mind \u2013 he was initially interested in a different virus and was looking for the site used by hepatitis B viruses to enter liver cells. Many researchers across the globe where involved in this mission, which Urban called the \u201cHoly Grail of hepatitis research\u201d because hepatitis B is so widespread. This formed the starting point of their meticulous work: They first had to find a way of propagating the virus in cell cultures so that its replication process could be studied. The second step involved determining the correct receptor from a large number of candidates. \u201cWe used parts of the viral envelope sequence to generate protein fragments that mimick a part of the natural viral envelope, which we added to non-infected liver cells to see if we could inhibit viral entry,\u201d says Urban. They finally made a discovery:", "The virus used a bile salt transporter, the NTCP receptor (NTCP: sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide), to enter the cell like a stowaway. Virions, i.e. infectious virus particles outside of the host cell, are unable to enter the cell when this transporter is blocked by these synthetically produced protein fragments. Blocking just some of the receptors is enough to prevent virions from entering. \u201cOur clinical studies show that Hepcludex is effective in very low concentrations, so that bile salt transporters can continue to operate for the cell,\u201d Urban summarises.", "Hepatitis D infection only occurs as an HBV co-infection because the D virus is unable to produce its own viral envelope. Instead, like a parasite of a parasite, it uses parts of the B virus to enter the liver cell. Effective but non-curative treatments for hepatitis B exist and with this small protein fragment, Urban and his team had now created the first effective hepatitis D drug in the world. Subsequently, Hepcludex was granted PRIME scheme eligibility by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). PRIME is short for \u201cPriority Medicines\u201d and was launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. On 28 May 2020, EMA recommended Hepcludex for approval and the European Commission has now approved it for prescription in Europe.", "Heidelberg\u2019s success story continues beyond the approval of Hepcludex for the treatment of hepatitis D. A few years ago, at the same institute, a pivotal contribution was made towards the development of hepatitis C drugs. Using information discovered about hepatitis C\u2019s molecular characteristics and replication cycle, Prof. Ralf Bartenschlager, Director of the UKHD Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, elicited sites that could be targeted for developing antivirals. He has been accompanying and supporting Stephan Urban\u2019s research for many years: \u201cViral hepatitis in its different forms poses an immense global public health problem,\u201d says Bartenschlager. He congratulates Stephan Urban\u2019s team for their success and also adds some food for thought with regard to research funding in Germany. \u201cI would wish for more consistent and long-term government funding for projects that are transitioning from basic research to the development of clinical applications, so that in future, promising projects no longer fail at the stage of finding funders.\u201d In his view, a positive example is the Trans regional Research Centre (TRR) 179 \u201cDeterminants and Dynamics of Elimination versus Persistence of Hepatitis Virus Infection\u201d at the Medical Faulty of Heidelberg, which he heads. It is being funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is currently in a second period of funding with approximately 13 million euro. This strengthens Heidelberg as a hepatitis research site. The DZIF was also founded with the specific aim of translating anti-infective agents into clinical applications.", "There are comparatively few people suffering from hepatitis D infection in Germany. A part of the reason for this is that many people are vaccinated against hepatitis B through which they are also protected against hepatitis D. \u201cThe Robert Koch Institute estimates that approximately 240,000 people in Germany suffer from chronic HBV infection. We expect that approximately 2.5 percent of these people are co-infected with HDV, which corresponds to approximately 6,000 people,\u201d says Stephan Urban. \u201cHowever, we do not have precise figures as many people with HBV infection have not been additionally tested for hepatitis D.\u201d Prof. Uta Merle, Acting Medical Director of the Clinic for Gastroenterology, Infectious Diseases and Poisoning at the UKHD, treated several hepatitis D patients within clinical trials and underlines the implications of having a new agent: \u201cChronic infections with hepatitis D are particularly aggressive and difficult to treat. Patients with chronic hepatitis D often develop hepatic restructuring through to liver cirrhosis within five to ten years of infection. This severe course is observed in 70 to 90 percent of HDV infections including those in young people. At the stage of liver cirrhosis and its complications, a liver transplant is the only treatment option,\u201d she summarises. This most severe form of hepatitis is particularly widespread in Africa, South America, Mongolia, Russia and Eastern Europe and many are unaware of their infection because of a lack of testing methods.

However, as established treatment for hepatitis B already exist, the prerequisites for fast track approval for HBV monoinfection were not met which is why Hepcludex can initially only be used for patients who are particularly severely affected by dual infections. \u201cIn future, it will be very interesting to examine whether a combination of Hepcludex and an immune modulator can also cure HBV patients who are not co-infected with HDV,\u201d says Stephan Urban."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/hepatitis-d-drug-hepcludex-receives-approval-by-the-european-commission-79168/", "region": "Drugs and antibiotics"},

{"title": "\r\n        Malaria: Artemisinin resistant strain reported in Rwanda        ", "date": "August 4, 2020", "body": ["Resistance to artemisinin, the main component of the current antimalarial treatments recommended by WHO, is already widespread in South-East Asia, but it had not previously been described in Africa. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Program in Rwanda (Rwanda Biomedical Center), the World Health Organization (WHO), Cochin Hospital and Columbia University (New York, USA), recently detected the emergence and spread of malaria parasites capable of resisting artemisinin derivatives for the first time in Rwanda. The results of the research were published on August 3, 2020 in\u00a0", ".", "Malaria, caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, represents a major public health problem. Almost 3.2 billion people (virtually half the world\u2019s population) in 89 countries are at risk of contracting the disease, for which there is currently no vaccine. Every year, over 200 million cases and over 400,000 deaths are recorded.", "For more than 15 years, treatment of malaria episodes (typical cycles of the disease alternating between fever, shivering and chills, and severe sweating) caused by Plasmodium falciparum has depended on artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which combine a fast-acting artemisinin derivative and a partner drug with a long half-life. Since 2008, parasites capable of resisting artemisinin derivatives in South-East Asia (Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos) have become increasingly prevalent. This resistance, which leads to a delay in the clearance of parasites from the bloodstream of individuals treated with an ACT, is currently a serious threat that may hinder efforts to tackle the disease. A major concern is that these resistant parasites will spread through Sub-Saharan Africa, the continent most affected by malaria (>90% of cases), as was the case with previous generations of antimalarial treatments (chloroquine and folic acid antagonists). In the 1980s, the reduced efficacy of chloroquine is thought to have contributed to several million additional deaths from malaria in young African children.", "Since 2014, the geographical distribution of artemisinin resistance has been monitored based on the detection of mutations in the Kelch13 gene in parasites. These mutations are believed to reduce the function of the Kelch13 protein, thought to be involved in hemoglobin degradation in infected red blood cells. Currently, the most widespread resistant parasites in South-East Asia have the C580Y mutation. Recently, C580Y mutant parasites have also been detected in Guyana and Papua New Guinea. In Africa, where ACTs remain very effective, Kelch13 mutant parasites have remained rare. For instance, the KARMA study, the first global map of artemisinin resistance, showed that less than 5% of African samples had mutations and that more than 50% of the mutants detected had only been observed once. Scientists also demonstrated that the most frequently observed mutation in Africa (A578S) did not confer artemisinin resistance to gene-edited Asian parasites.", "Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, involved in a WHO-supported project on molecular monitoring of resistance in Africa, recently identified the first signs of emergence of artemisinin-resistant Kelch13 mutant parasites in Africa. The results describe significant proportions of parasites carrying the R561H mutation in two locations 100km apart (prevalences of 7.4% in Masaka and 0.7% in Rukara, respectively). Whole-genome sequencing of these parasites indicates that the R561H mutants were selected from Rwandan parasite populations and that they had not spread from Asian parasites (from Thailand or Myanmar, where the R561H mutation has previously been observed). \u201cThese unexpected results contrast with previous scenarios in which the emergence of chloroquine- or pyrimethamine-resistant parasites in Africa was caused by the spread of resistant parasites from South-East Asia. It was thought that a similar scenario would apply for the emergence of artemisinin-resistant parasites in Africa,\u201d explains Didier M\u00e9nard, Head of the Malaria Genetics and Resistance Unit at the Institut Pasteur. The fact that this resistant strain has spread between several places in Rwanda and its ability to resist artemisinin in vitro have major public health implications. In the absence of effective measures to contain the spread of resistant parasites in Rwanda and neighboring countries, there is a risk that over time they will acquire the ability to resist the partner drugs used in ACTs. This would mean that the only available treatments would become ineffective, as has occurred in South-East Asia. A model of this scenario, in which no measures are taken, recently predicted that the inefficacy of ACTs in Africa could be responsible for 78 million additional cases and 116,000 additional deaths over a five-year period."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/malaria-artemisinin-resistant-strain-reported-in-rwanda-84139/", "region": "Africa"},

In order to obtain an effective therapy for COVID-19 as quickly as possible, drugs that are being used to treat other diseases are currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. The Infection Biology Unit of the German Primate Center (DPZ) \u2013 Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in G\u00f6ttingen, together with colleagues at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin, was able to show that the malaria drug chloroquine, which has been demonstrated to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection of African green monkey kidney cells, is not able to prevent infection of human lung cells with the novel coronavirus. Chloroquine is therefore unlikely to prevent the spread of the virus in the lung and should not be used for the treatment of COVID-19 (", ").", "It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is able to use two different routes to enter cells. First, after attaching to the cells, the virus can fuse directly with the plasma membrane and introduce its genetic material into the host cell. Second, it can enter the interior of the cells upon uptake via transport structures, called endosomes. In both cases, the attachment of the virus to the cells and subsequent entry is mediated by the viral spike protein. For this purpose, the spike protein must be activated either by the enzyme cathepsin L (in endosomes) or by the enzyme TMPRSS2 (on the cell surface). Depending on the cell type, both enzymes or only one of them can be available for activation.", "Chloroquine is a drug that is used to treat malaria. Since chloroquine inhibits the infection of monkey kidney cells with SARS-CoV-2, chloroquine has been tested in clinical trials as a possible candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. However, how chloroquine inhibits the infection of monkey kidney cells was not clear. The current study shows that chloroquine inhibits viral entry into these cells, most likely by blocking cathepsin L activity. This raised the question whether chloroquine also inhibits the infection of lung cells that are known to produce TMPRSS2 but only a small amount of cathepsin L.", "The study shows that chloroquine does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into human lung cells and subsequent spread of the virus in these cells. \u201cIn this study, we show that the antiviral activity of chloroquine is cell type-specific and that chloroquine does not block the infection of lung cells.

As standard clinical practice in the U.S., they explain, patients who are thought to have this infection are typically treated first with the broad spectrum antibiotic ceftriaxone while they wait for a microbiology lab to identify the causative organism from blood or cerebrospinal fluid samples. Once the organism is identified as N meningitidis, patients are typically treated with penicillin or ampicillin, antibiotics with a narrower spectrum of activity that\u2019s less likely to lead to ceftriaxone resistance. Family members and other close contacts are often prophylactically treated with an antibiotic called ciprofloxacin.", "Because N. meningitidis has historically been sensitive to these antibiotics, most laboratories do not perform tests to confirm drug susceptibility, Dr. Campos says.

Their drug, an engineered monoclonal antibody that targets the virus, has shown success in early-stage clinical trials in Singapore.", "This class of antibodies holds promise for treating a variety of infectious diseases, but it usually takes several years to develop and test them. The MIT-led researchers demonstrated that they could design, produce, and begin clinical trials of their antibody drug within seven months.", "Their approach, which condenses the timeline by performing many of the steps necessary for drug development in parallel, could also be applied to developing new treatments for Covid-19, says Sasisekharan, the Alfred H.

Building blocks from a database of all known antibody elements are selected based on several criteria, including their functional importance, to build candidate antibodies to evaluate. Testing these candidates provides valuable feedback, and the design loop continues until an optimized antibody that fully neutralizes the target virus is identified.", "The group also explored new approaches to compress the timeline by performing many of the necessary steps in parallel, using analytical techniques to address regulatory risks associated with drug safety, manufacturing, and clinical study design.", "Using this approach, the researchers developed a candidate Zika treatment within nine months. They performed phase 1a clinical trials to test for safety in March 2018, but by the time they were ready to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness in patients, the outbreak had ended. However, the team hopes to eventually test it in areas where the disease is still present.", "Sasisekharan and his colleagues then decided to see if they could apply the same approach to developing a potential treatment for yellow fever.

They identified promising antibody candidates based on their ability to bind to the viral envelope and neutralize the virus that causes yellow fever.", "The researchers narrowed their candidates down to one antibody, which they called TY014. They then developed production methods to create small, uniform batches that they could use to perform necessary testing phases in parallel. These tests include studying the drugs\u2019 effectiveness in human cells, determining the most effective dosages, testing for potential toxicity, and analyzing how the drug behaves in animal models. As soon as they had results indicating that the treatment would be safe, they began clinical trials in December 2018.", "\u201cThe mindset in the industry is that it\u2019s like a relay race.

They first vaccinated volunteers, then 24 hours later, they gave them either the experimental antibody drug or a placebo. Two days after that, they measured whether the drug cleared the weakened viruses that make up the vaccine.", "The researchers found that following treatment, the virus was undetectable in blood samples from people who received the antibodies.

It consists of four variant dengue antigens, one for each of the four serotypes of dengue, expressed from attenuated yellow-fever virus. The current three doses of immunisation with the tetravalent vaccine induces only suboptimal protection against DENV1 and DENV2. Furthermore, in people who have not been infected by dengue, the vaccine induces a more severe dengue infection in the future. Therefore in most of the world, the vaccination is only given to those who have been previously infected.", "To help overcome these issues, SMART researchers tested on mice whether sequential immunisation (or one serotype per dose) induces stronger and broader immunity against four DENV serotypes than tetravalent-formulated immunisation \u2013 and found that sequential immunisation induced significantly higher levels of virus-specific T cell responses than tetravalent immunisation. Moreover, sequential immunisation induced higher levels of neutralising antibodies to all four DENV serotypes than tetravalent vaccination.", "\u201cThe principle of sequential immunisation generally aligns with the reality for individuals living in dengue endemic areas, whose immune responses may become protective after multiple heterotypic exposures,\u201d said Professor Eng Eong Ooi, SMART AMR Principal Investigator and senior author of the study.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe were able to find a similar affect based on the use of sequential immunisation, which will pave the way for a safe and effective use of the vaccine and to combat the virus.\u201d", "Upon these promising results, the investigators will aim to test the sequential immunisation in humans in the near future.", "COVID-19 may have dominated the headlines this year, but concern has steadily grown in Singapore over another public health threat \u2013 dengue fever.

Their model assumes that the spread of COVID-19 in African countries will be similar to other countries that were affected earlier in the pandemic and were unable to control the virus. It assumes around 60% of the population will become infected and that the potential disruption to health services will last for six months.", "Exact data on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with routine clinic trips for childhood immunisations were not available, so the model was based on assumptions relating to the likely number of people encountered during such a journey, both at the clinic itself as well as during travel there and back again. Risks to the child, accompanying adult and any household members were taken into account. The model also accounted for the household size and age composition in each country, as risk of death from COVID-19 is known to substantially increase with age.", "\n", "The researchers based their estimates of the number of childhood deaths that could be prevented by routine immunisations on existing health data from each country. They focused on the impact of vaccines for diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterial causes of pneumonia and meningitis), rotavirus, measles, rubella, meningitis A and yellow fever. Vaccination rates for each country were assumed to be the same as in 2018.", "According to the model, continuing with routine immunisation programmes may lead to 8,300 additional deaths across Africa (uncertainty interval 1,300 to 25,000), attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with children visiting immunisation clinics.", "However, suspending such vaccination programmes to avoid excess COVID-19 deaths could lead to 702,000 children across Africa dying from preventable diseases before the age of five (uncertainty interval 635,000 and 782,000), according to the model. The researchers say this scenario assumes no catch-up vaccination campaigns at the end of the COVID-19 risk period and may overestimate the negative impact of suspending vaccination services for a short period of time.", "Even in a much more conservative scenario (where suspending vaccination is primarily assumed to increase the chance of a local measles outbreak and children would be protected from other diseases from existing immunity in the population or catch-up immunisation campaigns at the end of the COVID-19 risk period), the number of childhood deaths that could be prevented was still greater than the potential increase in COVID-19 deaths for most countries of Africa.", "Dr Tewodaj Mengistu, co-author of the study, from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Switzerland, said: \u201cRoutine immunisation programmes are facing enormous disruption across the globe due to this pandemic. Lockdowns make it harder for vaccinators and parents to reach vaccination sessions, health workers are being diverted to COVID-19 response, and misinformation and fear are keeping parents away. This important study shows just how big an impact this could have, risking the resurgence of diseases that vaccines have kept largely at bay.\u201d", "Findings were similar for all 54 countries of Africa, ranging from between 4 and 124 preventable child deaths in Morocco to between 28 and 598 in Angola, for each excess COVID-19 death. One third of vaccine-preventable deaths would be in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, the study found. Around one third of vaccine-preventable deaths would be caused by measles, and another third would be attributable to pertussis, according to the model.", "While the study clearly shows the health benefits of vaccination for children, it revealed that the additional risk of COVID-19 infections acquired during visits to the clinic would primarily affect adults from the same household. According to the model, 11% of excess COVID-19 deaths attributable to clinic visits are expected to affect parents or adult carers and 88% are predicted to affect older adults living in the same household as the vaccinated children. The researchers say this highlights the importance of shielding older adults to lower their risk of acquiring COVID-19, while children in their households can benefit from routine vaccinations.", "Dr Stefan Flasche, senior author of the study, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK, said: \u201cWe found that the biggest factors affecting the benefit of maintaining childhood immunisations during the pandemic are the likelihood of transmission of COVID-19 during clinic visits and the number of people encountered at the clinic. This highlights the need for personal protective equipment for clinic staff, the need to implement physical distancing measures and avoid crowded waiting rooms, and the importance of good hygiene practices to reduce virus transmission.\u201d", "The authors acknowledge that other factors must be considered when making decisions on sustaining routine childhood immunisation programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study harnesses the evolutionary idea of natural selection, but then applies it outside of the biological context, thus creating an evolution in a test tube approach.

In a similar fashion, molecules can be made to compete with each other for a particular characteristic. For example, this characteristic might be sticking to specific molecular markers which only exist in the presence of a disease.

But heparin, a blood thinner also available in non-anticoagulant varieties, binds tightly with the surface spike protein, potentially blocking the infection from happening. This makes it a decoy, which might be introduced into the body using a nasal spray or nebulizer and run interference to lower the odds of infection.

But the virus could just as easily be persuaded to lock onto a decoy molecule, provided that molecule offers the same fit as the cellular target. Once bound to a decoy, the virus would be neutralized, unable to infect a cell or free itself, and would eventually degrade.", "In humans, SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor, and the researchers hypothesized that heparin would offer an equally attractive target.

In addition to the direct binding assay, the team tested how strongly three heparin variants \u2014 including a non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin \u2014 bind to SARS-CoV-2, and used computational modeling to determine the specific sites where the compounds bind to the virus. All the results confirm heparin as a promising candidate for the decoy strategy.

That suggests health authorities there have considered patients\u2019 chances of recovery in deciding who receives access to intensive care, the researchers say.", "\u201c", " that individually driven infection-control measures can have a substantial effect on national outcomes, and we see Sweden as a good example of this case,\u201d said Peter Kasson, MD, PhD, of the University of Virginia School of Medicine and Sweden\u2019s Uppsala University. \u201cHigher levels of individual action would further suppress the infection, while a complete lack of individual action would likely have led to runaway infection, which fortunately hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d", "Kasson and Uppsala\u2019s Lynn Kamerlin set out to analyze the effects of the country\u2019s public-health response using population, employment and household data. They say the insights gained from their work can guide future public-health policies. In particular, the findings will help doctors understand the effects of individual compliance with infection-control measures.", "The researchers conclude that Sweden\u2019s \u201cmild\u201d government restrictions, coupled with a population willing to voluntarily self-isolate, produced results quite similar to those seen in countries that enacted more stringent measures later in the pandemic.", "Sweden\u2019s per capita death rate was 35 per 100,000 as of May 15. Meanwhile, Denmark\u2019s death rate was 9.3 per 100,000, Finland\u2019s 5.2 and Norway\u2019s 4.7. All three neighboring countries enacted stricter policies. For comparison, the United States had 24 deaths per 100,000 as of May 15. But Sweden has fared better than hard-hit countries such as the United Kingdom and Spain.", "\u201cSweden is perhaps the most prominent example of mitigation \u2014 limiting the extent of socially and economically disruptive interventions while still aiming to slow spread and allow for an effective medical response,\u201d the researchers wrote in a new paper outlining their findings. \u201cStudying the effects of this strategy, which elements are key to reducing mortality and healthcare need, and how it might compare to other approaches, is thus of critical importance to the global understanding of pandemic responses.\u201d", "While it did not opt for full lockdown, Sweden took several steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The researchers created computer models to measure the effects of these steps, including voluntary self-isolation by symptomatic people and those over 70, closing schools and other interventions. They then validated their results by comparing the models with Sweden\u2019s death rate and compared Sweden\u2019s results to other countries\u2019.", "The researchers\u2019 models anticipated that Sweden\u2019s public-health mandates would result in 40 times more patients needing ICU beds than the number of ICU beds available before the pandemic. Voluntary self-isolation reduced this to five-fold, and the country essentially doubled its number of ICU beds as the pandemic emerged.", "That still leaves many patients without a bed, however, and yet the country\u2019s ICUs weren\u2019t overrun. That outcome \u2013 and the fact older patients in Sweden were several times more likely to die than to be admitted to an ICU \u2013 prompted the researchers to analyze choices that Swedish health authorities made about who would receive intensive care.", "\u201cAnalyzed by categorical age group, older Swedish patients with confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to die than to be admitted to the ICU, suggesting that predicted prognosis may have been a factor in ICU admission,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThis likely reduced ICU load at the cost of more high-risk patients dying outside the ICU.\u201d", "\u201cThe key finding is that individual actions matter,\u201d Kasson said. \u201cIf enough individuals stay home and take precautions when in the community, it can really change the infection curve.

The authors estimate that 4% of the world\u2019s population (349 million of 7.8 billion people) would require hospitalization if infected, suggesting that the increased risk of severe COVID-19 could be quite modest for many with underlying conditions.", "Guidelines published by the WHO and by public health agencies in the UK and USA identify risk factors for severe COVID-19, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. The new study provides global, regional and national estimates for the number of people with underlying health conditions. The authors caution that they focused on underlying chronic conditions and didn\u2019t include other possible risk factors for COVID-19 that are not yet included in all guidelines, such as ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation. Their estimates are therefore unlikely to be exhaustive, but serve as a starting point for policy-makers.", "The authors based their estimates on disease prevalence data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017, UN population estimates for 2020 and the list of underlying health conditions relevant to COVID-19, as defined by current guidelines. The authors point out that the GBD prevalence estimates are likely to be higher than those from national databases, because they\u2019re designed to capture cases that might be undiagnosed or not severe enough to be included in electronic health records. They analysed the number of people with an underlying condition by age group, sex and country for 188 countries.", "To help determine the degree of increased risk, the researchers also provided separate estimates of the proportion of all people (with and without underlying conditions) who would require hospitalization if infected. The authors calculated those at high risk using infection hospitalization ratios for COVID-19 and made adjustments for differences between countries.", "Countries and regions with younger populations have fewer people with at least one underlying health condition, while those with older populations have more people with at least one condition. For example, the proportion of the population with one or more health condition ranges from 16% in Africa (283 million people out of 1.3 billion) to 31% in Europe (231 million out of 747 million).", "However, Associate Professor Clark cautions that the evidence needs to be carefully communicated to avoid complacency about risk in Africa: \u201cThe share of the population at increased risk of severe COVID-19 is generally lower in Africa than elsewhere due to much younger country populations, but a much higher proportion of severe cases could be fatal in Africa than elsewhere.\u201d", "Small island nations with high diabetes prevalence, such as Fiji and Mauritius, have among the highest proportion of people with an underlying condition. In Africa, countries with the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence, such as Eswatini and Lesotho, have a greater proportion of people with an underlying condition than countries with lower prevalence, such as Niger.", "Globally, less than 5% of people aged under 20 years, but more than 66% of those aged 70 and above, have at least one underlying condition that could increase their risk of severe COVID-19. Among the working age population (15 to 64 years), 23% are estimated to have at least one underlying condition. The prevalence of one or more condition listed on current guidelines is similar between the sexes, but the authors assumed males were twice as likely as females to require hospitalization if infected.", "The authors estimate that 349 million people worldwide are at high risk of severe COVID-19, meaning they would require hospital treatment if infected. This risk varies from less than 1% of people under 20 to nearly 20% of those aged 70 or older, rising to more than 25% in males over 70. In all age groups under 65, around twice the number of men as women would require hospitalisation. Above 65 years, the ratio becomes less marked because women are over-represented in older age groups due to longer life expectancy.", "\u201cOur estimates suggest that age-based thresholds for shielding could play a role in reducing deaths and reducing the number of people who require hospital treatment, but the choice of threshold needs to be balanced against the proportion of people of working age affected, as well as the health and economic consequences that might be associated with long periods of isolation,\u201d says Dr Rosalind Eggo from LSHTM.", "Writing in a linked Comment, lead author Professor Nina Schwalbe, MPH, (who was not involved in the study) from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, USA, says: \u201cAn increased understanding of risk factors, including the effects of social determinants and their interplay, provides an opportunity to target mitigation strategies and helps to allay the popular misconception that everyone is at equal risk of severe illness. As the authors note, it is time to evolve from a one-size-fits-all approach to one that centres on those most at risk. This will need to happen at both the individual and community level. Considering the relevance of social determinants, such an approach requires urgently improving communication about COVID-19; increasing access to health services, including palliative care, for those already socially vulnerable; and providing economic support to cope with the mitigation.\u201d"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/severe-covid-19-infection-one-in-five-people-globally-have-an-underlying-health-condition-that-could-increase-their-risk-89239/", "region": "Research"},

University of North Carolina School of Medicine researchers designed experiments using gene-editing tools to discover how molecules called gangliosides serve as de facto gatekeepers to allow the virus entry into liver cells.", "The research, published in\u00a0", ", has revealed gangliosides as a key player in HAV and has led to several other questions, such as how exactly viral RNA transitions between different compartments in human liver cells to replicate and cause disease.", "\u201cDiscovering that gangliosides are essential receptors for HAV infection adds an interesting plot twist to the hepatitis A story,\u201d said senior author Stanley Lemon, MD, professor of medicine and microbiology at the UNC School of Medicine and member of the UNC Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases. \u201cGangliosides are structurally similar across mammalian species, unlike proteins, which helps explain cross-species transmission of ancient hepatoviruses. Understanding what helps a virus jump from one animal species to another is incredibly important, as evidenced so plainly by the current Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d", "HAV was discovered nearly 50 years ago, and although there is a vaccine, there is no treatment. The virus still infects more than 1.4 million people globally each year, and in recent years has been causing increasing numbers of hepatitis cases in the United States, some fatal. Many people experience very mild or no symptoms, especially children. Patients with symptoms, which can last eight weeks and sometimes longer, often experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. After initial infection, 10 to 15 percent of infected individuals experience a recurrence of symptoms during the first six months. Acute liver failure is rare, but more common in elderly people.", "HAV infects people through mechanisms similar to other viruses; it interacts with receptor molecules on the surface of human cells to gain entry. Knowing the receptor for a virus not only helps researchers understand how the virus enters cells, but also creates opportunities to design antivirals to block the interaction to prevent or treat disease.", "Among the five known hepatitis viruses that cause acute or chronic liver disease in humans, receptors have been identified for hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus. For hepatitis A, the identity of the receptor remained elusive. The black sheep of the picornavirus family, it uniquely exists in two modes: as nonenveloped (naked) viruses (nHAV), comprised of a protein shell called a capsid surrounding an RNA genome; or as \u2018quasi-enveloped\u2019 viruses (eHAV), in which capsids containing the viral genome are cloaked inside host cell membranes.", "Once inside the liver, eHAV is released from infected hepatocytes to circulate in the blood, whereas naked nHAV particles are shed in feces. Both virus types are infectious. Being cloaked with host-derived membranes gives eHAV an advantage in evading antibody responses, while the naked virion is extraordinarily stable and spreads readily in the environment. But how did each virus get into liver cells and the blood in the first place?", "Years ago, the human protein TIM1 was reported to be a receptor for HAV. The gene that encodes this protein even bears the official name HAV cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1). But recent studies in Lemon\u2019s laboratory showed that cells lacking TIM1 still allow HAV infection.", "To find a more likely culprit for the receptor, Anshuman Das, PhD, a postdoc in the Lemon lab at the time of this research and now at Duke University., used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to knock out approximately 20,000 genes in cultured cells to find which human genes are essential for the virus to invade. They identified five particular genes, all of which were required by the virus. Turns out, these genes encode enzymes or transporters that make possible the synthesis of gangliosides. (Transporters are molecules that traffic chemicals across channels inside cells.)", "Gangliosides are sugary fatty acid molecules. The enzyme ceramide glucosyltransferase creates gangliosides. And the gene UGCG encodes for that enzyme.", "\u201cUGCG was the lead culprit of the five genes that lit up our screen using CRISPR-Cas9,\u201d Lemon said.", "The researchers then knocked out UGCG, which prevented HAV infection. They also treated liver-derived cells with a chemical inhibitor of ceramide glucosyltransferase to prevent both eHAV and nHAV infection.", "The researchers then injected synthetic HAV RNA directly into cells to discover that the viral RNA replicated well, suggesting that gangliosides were required for entry of the virus into cells, but not needed for it to make copies of its genome, or new virus particles, once it gets into cells.", "\n", "Subsequent experiments revealed that \u2013 in the absence of gangliosides \u2013 both naked and quasi-enveloped HAV particles do in fact get part way into the cell, but they end up getting stuck in a compartment called the lysosome. Viral replication does not occur. When the researchers added back gangliosides, the accumulated viruses used the gangliosides to exit the lysosome and continue their invasion of the cell, ending up releasing their genomes into the cell cytoplasm where the virus then began to replicate.", "\u201cThis means gangliosides are essential for a late-step entry of HAV into cells,\u201d said Anshuman Das, PhD, a postdoc in the Lemon lab at the time of this research and now at Duke University. \u201cThey function as true receptors.\u201d", "Although questions remain, the researchers say that understanding the role of gangliosides may open up new avenues for prevention and possibly even treatment of hepatitis A."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/unc-researchers-discover-gatekeeper-to-hepatitis-a-virus-infection-of-human-cells-41318/", "region": "Research"},

The results of the study were ", ".", "Tick-borne encephalitis is common in Central and Eastern Europe and a wide band in southern Siberia and the Far East. This disease is dangerous due to the ability of the virus to penetrate the brain and spinal cord, causing motor disorders, cognitive impairments and, in severe cases, paralysis and death. Every year in Russia, 1,500-2,000 people are infected, with about 30% developing neurological complications and 20-100 people dying.", "The pathogen belongs to the genus Flavivirus (it also includes Zika virus and the virus that causes dengue fever) and is transmitted mainly through tick bites. There are three subtypes of the virus: Far Eastern, Siberian and European. Each of them is predominant in the region after which it is named, although this division is quite coarse \u2013 for example, cases of infection with the Siberian subtype were observed in the Baltic States and Sakhalin, and with the European one \u2013 in South Korea and the Altai Mountains. In recent years, the spread of the virus has expanded to northern areas (Kola Peninsula, Arkhangelsk Region) and mountainous regions (in Central Europe and Italy). In 2019, the first cases of infection were recorded in the UK and the Netherlands. To respond promptly to the emergence of the virus in new territories, it is necessary to understand what affects its spread and evolution. Existing studies provide different, sometimes contradictory results, but new data collected in recent years can clarify the situation.", "The authors of the article used GenBank \u2013 a database that stores more than 200 million nucleotide sequences of RNA and DNA of various species. The data are supplied by scientists from different countries, and their volume is constantly growing, in common with the number of sequences describing the RNA of the tick-borne encephalitis virus \u2013 in ten years the number has increased fivefold.", "Using computer algorithms, researchers compared the RNA of viruses found in different years on the territory of several countries. Knowing the \u2018distance\u2019 (the proportion of divergent nucleotides) between samples and the date of their receipt, one can estimate the time of divergence of species or the division of a species into subtypes. This method is based on the assumption that the sequence of nucleotides in a single species changes at an approximately constant rate, and is called the molecular clock. Using this method, scientists estimated the age of the most recent common ancestor for each of the subtypes. The result (about 700 and 900 years for the Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes, respectively) is consistent with earlier studies, while the age of the European subtype (about 1,600 years) was estimated for the first time after the virus was spotted in the Netherlands.", "The researchers also tried to find out how genetically similar viruses of the same subtype ended up in different countries at a distance of thousands of kilometres from each other. There are several possible explanations. First, viruses (or ticks infected with them) can travel long distances with animals, such as migratory birds or bats. Second, human activity can contribute to the spread of the virus: transportation of livestock or introduction of animals suitable for hunting in new territories.", "\u2018The most important result of the work was that most of the virus spreading events occurred in the last three or four centuries, and in many cases we have observed the transfer of the virus for thousands of kilometres in the last 50-100 years, and viruses in Europe have completely mixed over the last 100-200 years,\u2019 said Alexander Lukashev, one of the authors of the work, Director of the Institute of Medical Parasitology and Tropical Medicine at Sechenov University. \u2018This allows us to consider tick-borne encephalitis as a highly dynamic disease, even as an emerging disease in many regions, and to think about an anthropogenic factor (the spread of infected ticks as a result of transportation of domestic and wild animals) as one of the main mechanisms behind the expansion of the virus.\u2019", "In addition, scientists have proposed an algorithm that simulates the compilation of samples as used in earlier studies.

The current study indicates that this is not the case, although it looked only at ACE2 concentrations in plasma, not in tissues such as lung tissue. In addition, the study cannot provide definitive evidence on the effects of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. Its conclusions are mainly restricted to heart failure patients, and the patients did not have COVID-19, so the researchers cannot provide a direct link between the course of the disease and ACE2 plasma concentrations.", "Prof Voors said: \u201cACE2 is a receptor on the surface of cells. It binds to the coronavirus and allows it to enter and infect healthy cells after it is has been modified by another protein on the surface of the cell, called TMPRSS2. High levels of ACE2 are present in the lungs and, therefore, it is thought to play a crucial role in the progression of lung disorders related to COVID-19.\u201d", "Prof Voors and his colleagues were already studying differences in markers of disease in the blood between men and women before the coronavirus outbreak. The results became available soon after the pandemic began.", "The first author of the study, Dr Iziah Sama from UMC Groningen, said: \u201cWhen we found that one of the strongest biomarkers, ACE2, was much higher in men than in women, I realised that this had the potential to explain why men were more likely to die from COVID-19 than women.\u201d", "The researchers measured ACE2 concentrations in blood samples taken from two groups of heart failure patients from 11 European countries. There were 1485 men and 537 women in the first group, the index cohort, which was designed to test the researchers\u2019 hypotheses and research questions. Then the researchers validated their findings in a second group of 1123 men and 575 women, the validation cohort.", "The median (average) age of the participants in the index cohort was 69 years for men and 75 years for women, and in the validation cohort it was 74 and 76 years, respectively.", "When the researchers looked at a number of clinical factors that could play a role in ACE2 concentrations, including the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), as well as a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery by-pass graft and atrial fibrillation, they found that male sex was the strongest predictor of elevated ACE2 concentrations. In the index cohort, ACE inhibitors, ARBS and MRAs were not associated with greater ACE2 plasma concentrations, and in the validation cohort, ACE inhibitors and ARBs were associated with lower ACE2 concentrations, while MRAs were only weakly associated with higher concentrations.", "\u201cTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first substantial study to examine the association between plasma ACE2 concentrations and the use of blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with cardiovascular disease. We found no evidence that ACE inhibitors and ARBs were linked to increased ACE2 concentrations in plasma. In fact, they predicted lower concentrations of ACE2 in the validation cohort, although we did not see this in the index cohort,\u201d said Prof Voors.", "\u201cThe effect of MRAs on ACE2 concentrations is not clear, as the weak increase in concentrations in the validation cohort was not seen in the index cohort. Our findings do not suggest that MRAs should be discontinued in heart failure patients who develop COVID-19. They are a very effective treatment for heart failure and the hypothetical effects on viral infection should be weighed carefully against their proven benefits,\u201d he said.", "ACE2 is found not only in the lungs, but also the heart, kidneys and the tissues lining blood vessels, and there are particularly high levels in the testes. The researchers speculate that its regulation in the testes might partially explain higher ACE2 concentrations in men, and why men are more vulnerable to COVID-19.", "Other limitations of the study include the fact that the researchers only measured concentrations of ACE2 in plasma, not in tissues, so they cannot be sure that concentrations in the blood are similar to those seen in tissues; it is the ACE2 in the lung tissues that are thought to be important for viral infection of the lungs, not ACE2 concentrations in the blood.", "In an accompanying editorial, Professor Gavin Oudit, from the University of Alberta, Canada, and Professor Marc Pfeffer, from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, USA, write: \u201cWhen faced with the rapidly expanding COVID-19 pandemic and in the absence of definitive data, the results of Sama et al obtained in heart failure patients in the pre-COVID-19 period offer supporting evidence to continue ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

While it\u2019s not a direct evolutionary precursor of SARS-CoV-2, this new virus, RmYN02, suggests that these types of seemingly unusual insertion events can occur naturally in coronavirus evolution, the researchers say.", "\u201cSince the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 there have been a number of unfounded suggestions that the virus has a laboratory origin,\u201d says senior author Weifeng Shi, director and professor at the Institute of Pathogen Biology at Shandong First Medical University in China. \u201cIn particular, it has been proposed the S1/S2 insertion is highly unusual and perhaps indicative of laboratory manipulation. Our paper shows very clearly that these events occur naturally in wildlife. This provides strong evidence against SARS-CoV-2 being a laboratory escape.\u201d", "The researchers identified RmYN02 from an analysis of 227 bat samples collected in Yunnan province, China, between May and October of 2019. \u201cSince the discovery that bats were the reservoir of SARS coronavirus in 2005, there has been great interest in bats as reservoir species for infectious diseases, particularly as they carry a very high diversity of RNA viruses, including coronaviruses,\u201d Shi says. RNA from the samples was sent for metagenomic next-generation sequencing in early January 2020, soon after the discovery of SARS-CoV-2.", "Across the whole genome, the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 is another virus, called RaTG13, which was previously identified from bats in Yunnan province. But RmYN02, the virus newly discovered here, is even more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in some parts of the genome, including in the longest encoding section of the genome called 1ab, where they share 97.2% of their RNA. The researchers note that RmYN02 does not closely resemble SAR-CoV-2 in the region of the genome that encodes the key receptor binding domain that binds to the human ACE2 receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect host cells. This means it\u2019s not likely to infect human cells.", "The key similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and RmYN02, is the finding that RmYN02 also contains amino acid insertions at the point where the two subunits of its spike protein meet. SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by a four-amino-acid insertion at the junction of S1 and S2; this insertion is unique to the virus and has been present in all SARS-CoV-2 sequenced so far. The insertions in RmYN02 are not the same as those in SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that they occurred through independent insertion events. But a similar insertion event happening in a virus identified in bats strongly suggests that these kinds of insertions are of natural origin. \u201cOur findings suggest that these insertion events that initially appeared to be very unusual can, in fact, occur naturally in animal betacoronaviruses,\u201d Shi says.", "\u201cOur work sheds more light on the evolutionary ancestry of SARS-CoV-2,\u201d he adds. \u201cNeither RaTG13 nor RmYN02 is the direct ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, because there is still an evolutionary gap between these viruses. But our study strongly suggests that sampling of more wildlife species will reveal viruses that are even more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps even its direct ancestors, which will tell us a great deal about how this virus emerged in humans.\u201d"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/sars-cov-2-relative-found-in-bats-offers-more-evidence-it-evolved-naturally-chinese-researchers-92339/", "region": "Research"},

Many hospitals, including Barnes-Jewish Hospital, use software known as RAPID to analyze such brain scans.

During the pandemic period, software use per hospital averaged 0.72 patients per day, a drop of 39%.", "\u201cAcross the board, everybody is affected by this decrease,\u201d said Kansagra, who is also an assistant professor of neurosurgery and of neurology. \u201cIt is not limited to just hospitals in urban settings or rural communities, small hospitals or large hospitals. It is not just the old or the young or the people with minor strokes who aren\u2019t showing up. Even patients with really severe strokes are seeking care at reduced rates. This is a widespread and very scary phenomenon.\u201d", "There\u2019s no reason to believe people suddenly stopped having strokes.

Furthermore, the treatment combination appeared safe and well tolerated by patients\u201d, says Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen from the University of Hong Kong who led the research.", "He continues, \u201cDespite these encouraging findings, we must confirm in larger phase 3 trials that interferon beta-1b alone or in combination with other drugs is effective in patients with more severe illness (in whom the virus has had more time to replicate).\u201d", "Previous research found that a combination of oral lopinavir-ritonavir (normally used to treat HIV) and ribavirin (an oral hepatitis C virus drug) significantly reduced respiratory failure and death in patients hospitalised with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 outbreak.

Secondary outcomes included time for symptoms of COVID-19 to go defined as achieving a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) score of 0; a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 0, indicating normal function; 30-day mortality; and length of hospital stay.", "Treatment with the triple drug combination effectively suppressed viral load (with no detectable virus) in the nasopharyngeal swab within an average 7 days of starting treatment, which was significantly shorter than the average 12 days in the control group, treated with lopinavir-ritonavir alone (table 2).", "Secondary outcomes supported the findings, indicating that clinical improvement was significantly better in the triple combination group\u2013with the triple therapy halving the time to complete alleviation of symptoms (average 4 days vs 8 days) and a SOFA score of 0 (average 3 days vs 8 days), and resulting in significantly shorter average hospital stay (9 days vs 14.5 days).", "Further secondary analyses also looked at timing of treatment and patient outcomes. They found that the 52 patients who started combination treatment (with interferon beta-1b) less than 7 days after the onset of symptoms had better clinical and virological outcomes than the control group who received their treatment at the same time. However, people who were treated 7 days or more after showing symptoms there was no difference in outcomes between the combination treatment and control groups (34 patients in the combination group, who received lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin but did not receive interferon beta-1b, and 17 in the control group).", "\u201cThese findings suggest that interferon beta 1-b may be a key component of the combination treatment and is worth further investigation for the treatment of COVID-19\u201d, says co-author Dr Jenny Lo from Ruttonjee Hospital in Hong Kong. \u201cInterferons are naturally occurring proteins, produced in response to viral infection, and the hope is that interferon beta-1b will boost the body\u2019s ability to fight SARS-CoV-2. Future phase 3 trials will soon confirm or refute the usefulness of this candidate drug as a backbone treatment for COVID-19.\u201d", "There was no difference in adverse events between the treatment groups (48%; 41/86 patient combination group vs 49%; 20/41 controls), and none of the side effects in the combination group were severe. One patient in the control group had a serious adverse event of liver dysfunction, and discontinuation treatment. The most common adverse events were diarrhoea, fever, and nausea. No patients died during the study.", "The authors highlight several limitations of the study, including that it was an open label study in which both the researchers and the patients knew the treatment the participants were receiving, and did not have a placebo group. They also note that the findings may be confounded by the subgroup of 34 patients within the combination group who were admitted 7 days or more after symptom onset, and were not offered interferon beta-1b, but were analysed as part of the combination group.", "Writing in a linked Comment, Dr Sarah Shalhoub (who was not involved in the study) from Western University in Canada says: \u201cMost published studies so far have been retrospective or observational. Therefore, this prospective, randomised controlled design adds notable value to the growing evidence on treatments, eliminating a number of limitations inherent to retrospective studies.\u201d", "She continues, \u201cThis study presents a step towards finding a much-needed therapy for SARS-CoV-2.

Shalek, PhD\u00a0at MIT, pinpoints the likely cell types the virus infects. Unexpectedly, it also shows that one of the body\u2019s main defenses against viral infections may actually help the virus infect those very cells. Findings were published\u00a0", ".", "The peer-reviewed study, published as a preprint, will help focus efforts to understand what SARS-COV-2 does in the body, why some people are more susceptible, and how best to search for treatments, the researchers say.", "When news broke about a new coronavirus in China, Ordovas-Montanes and Shalek had already been studying different cell types from throughout the human respiratory system and intestine. They also had gathered data from primates and mice.", "In February, they began diving into these data.", "\u201cWe started to look at cells from tissues such as the lining of the nasal cavity, the lungs, and gut, based on reported symptoms and where the virus has been detected,\u201d says Ordovas-Montanes. \u201cWe wanted to provide the best information possible across our entire spectrum of research models.\u201d", "Recent research had found that SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 like the closely related SARS-CoV that caused the SARS pandemic, uses a receptor called ACE2 to gain entry into human cells, aided by an enzyme called TMPRSS2. That led Ordovas-Montanes and Shalek and colleagues to ask a simple question: Which cells in respiratory and intestinal tissue express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2?", "To address this question, the team turned to single-cell RNA sequencing, which identifies which of roughly 20,000 genes are \u201con\u201d in individual cells. They found that only a tiny percentage of human respiratory and intestinal cells, often well below 10 percent, make both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Those cells fall in three types: goblet cells in the nose that secrete mucus; lung cells known as type II pneumocytes that help maintain the alveoli (the sacs where oxygen is taken in); and one type of so-called enterocytes that line the small intestine and are involved in nutrient absorption.", "Sampling from non-human primates showed a similar pattern of susceptible cells.", "\u201cMany existing respiratory cell lines may not contain the full mix of cell types, and may miss the types that are relevant,\u201d Ordovas-Montanes notes. \u201cOnce you understand which cells are infected, you can start to ask, \u2018How do these cells work?\u2019 \u2018Is there anything within these cells that is critical for the virus\u2019s life cycle?\u2019 With more refined cellular models, we can perform better screens to find what existing drugs target that biology, providing a stepping stone to go into mice or non-human primates.\u201d", "But it was the study\u2019s second finding that most intrigues the scientists. They discovered that the ACE2 gene, which encodes the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter human cells, is stimulated by interferon \u2014 one of the body\u2019s main defenses when it detects a virus. Interferon actually turned the ACE2 gene on at higher levels, potentially giving the virus new portals to get in.", "\u201cACE2 is also critical in protecting people during various types of lung injury,\u201d notes Ordovas-Montanes. \u201cWhen ACE2 comes up, that\u2019s usually a productive response. But since the virus uses ACE2 as a target, we speculate that it might be exploiting that normal protective response.\u201d", "Interferons, in fact, are being tested as a treatment for COVID-19. Would they help, or would they do more harm than good? That\u2019s not yet clear.", "\u201cIt might be that in some patients, because of the timing or the dose, interferon can contain the virus, while in others, interferon promotes more infection,\u201d says Ordovas-Montanes. \u201cWe want to better understand where the balance lies, and how we can maintain a productive antiviral response without producing more target cells for the virus to infect.\u201d", "The findings may also raise new lines of inquiry around ACE inhibitors. These drugs are commonly used to treat hypertension, which has been linked to more severe COVID-19 disease. Are ACE inhibitors affecting people\u2019s risk?", "\u201cACE and ACE2 work in the same pathway, but they actually have different biochemical properties,\u201d Ordovas-Montanes cautions. \u201cIt\u2019s complex biology, but it will be important to understand the impact of ACE inhibitors on people\u2019s physiological response to the virus.\u201d", "It\u2019s also too soon to try to relate the study findings to the \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d a runaway inflammatory response that has been reported in very sick COVID-19 patients. Cytokines are a family of chemicals that rally the body\u2019s immune responses to fight infections, and interferon is part of the family.", "\u201cIt might be that we\u2019re seeing a cytokine storm because of a failure of interferon to restrict the virus to begin with, so the lungs start calling for more help.

This suggests the importance of monitoring SARS-like coronaviruses in feral dogs in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.\u201d", "The findings appear in the advanced access online edition of the ", "Xia has long-studied the molecular signatures of viruses in different hosts. When viruses invade a host, their genomes often bear the battle scars from fighting off and evading the host\u2019s immune system through changes and adaptations found within their genomes.", "Humans and mammals have a key antiviral sentinel protein, called ZAP, which can stop a virus in its tracks by preventing its multiplication in the host and degrading its genome. The viral target is a pair of chemical letters, called CpG dinucleotides, within its RNA genome. CpG dinucleotides act as a signpost that a person\u2019s immune system uses to seek and destroy a virus. ZAP patrols human lungs, and is made in large amounts in the bone marrow and lymph nodes, where the immune system first primes its attack.", "But it\u2019s been shown that viruses can punch back. Single-stranded coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV, can avoid ZAP by reducing these CpG signposts, thus rendering ZAP powerless. A similar examination of HIV, another RNA virus, shows that it has also exploited this evolutionary trick to lose CpG in response to human antiviral defenses. One implication of this is that the remaining CpG dinucleotides on the viral genome are likely functionally important for the virus and could serve as target of modification to attenuate virulence in vaccine development.", "\u201cThink of a decreased amount of CpG in a viral pathogen as an increased threat to public health, while an increased amount of CpG decreases the threat of such viral pathogens,\u201d said Xia. \u201cA virus with an increased amount of CpG would be better targeted by the host immune system, and result in reduced virulence, which would be akin to natural vaccines.\u201d", "To perform the study, Xia examined all 1252 full-length betacoronavirus genomes deposited into GenBank to date. Xia found that SARS-CoV-2 and its most closely related known relative, a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13), have the lowest amount of CpG among its close coronavirus relatives.", "\u201cThe most striking pattern is an isolated but dramatic downward shift in viral genomic CpG in the lineage leading to BatCoV RaTG13 which was reported to be sampled from a bat (Rhinolophus affinis) in Yunnan Province in 2013 but only sequenced by Wuhan Institute of Virology after the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in late 2019,\u201d said Xia. \u201cThis bat CoV genome is the closest phylogenetic relative of SARS-CoV-2, sharing 96% sequence similarity.\u201d", "\u201cIn this context, it is unfortunate that BatCoV RaTG13 was not sequenced in 2013, otherwise the downshifting in CpG might have served as a warning due to two highly significant implications,\u201d said Xia. \u201cFirst, the virus likely evolved in a tissue with high ZAP expression which favors viral genomes with a low CpG. Second and more importantly, survival of the virus indicates that it has successfully evaded ZAP-mediated antiviral defense. In other words, the virus has become stealthy and dangerous to humans.\u201d", "Xia applied his CpG tool to reexamining the camel origin of MERS, and found those viruses infecting camel digestive system also had lower genomic CpG than those infecting camel respiratory system.", "When he examined the data in dogs, he found that only genomes from canine coronaviruses (CCoVs), which had caused a highly contagious intestinal disease worldwide in dogs, have genomic CpG values similar to those observed in SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13. Second, canids, like camels, also have coronaviruses infecting their digestive system with CpG lower than those infecting their respiratory system (canine respiratory coronavirus or CRCoV belonging to BetaCoV).", "In addition, the known cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell is ACE2 (angiotensin I converting enzyme 2). ACE2 is made in the human digestive system, at the highest levels in the small intestine and duodenum, with relatively low expression in the lung. This suggests that mammalian digestive systems are likely to be a key target infected by coronaviruses.", "\u201cThis is consistent with the interpretation that the low CpG in SARS-CoV-2 was acquired by the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 evolving in mammalian digestive systems and interpretation is further corroborated by a recent report that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients also suffer from digestive discomfort,\u201d said Xia. \u201cIn fact, 48.5% presented with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint.\u201d", "Humans are the only other host species Xia observed to produce coronavirus genomes with low genomic CpG values. In a comprehensive study of the first 12 COVID-19 patients in the U.S., one patient reported diarrhea as the initial symptom before developing fever and cough, and stool samples from 7 out of 10 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 3 patients with diarrhea.", "Canids are often observed to lick their anal and genital regions, not only during mating but also in other circumstances. Such behavior would facilitate viral transmission from the digestive system to the respiratory system and the interchange between a gastrointestinal pathogen and a respiratory tract and lung pathogen.", "\u201cIn this context, it is significant that the bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13), as documented in its genomic sequence in GenBank (MN996532), was isolated from a fecal swab. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved in mammalian intestine or tissues associated with intestine.\u201d", "Another finding of Xia\u2019s study involves viruses recently isolated from pangolins. Nine SARS-CoV-2-like genomes have recently been isolated and sequenced from pangolin and deposited in GISAID database (gisaid.org). \u201cThe one with the highest sequence coverage (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_410721) has an ICpG value of 0.3929, close to the extreme low end of the CpG values observed among available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, BatCoV RaTG13 and those from pangolin may either have a common ancestor with a low CpG or have convergently evolved low CpG values.\u201d", "Based on his results, Xia presents a scenario in which the coronavirus first spread from bats to stray dogs eating bat meat. Next, the presumably strong selection against CpG in the viral RNA genome in canid intestines resulted in rapid evolution of the virus leading to reduced genomic CpG. Finally, the reduced viral genomic CpG allowed the virus to evade human ZAP-mediated immune response and became a severe human pathogen.", "\u201cWhile the specific origins of SARS-CoV-2 are of vital interest in the current world health crisis, this study more broadly suggests that important evidence of viral evolution can be revealed by consideration of the interaction of host defenses with viral genomes, including selective pressure exerted by host tissues on viral genome composition,\u201d said Xia."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/origin-of-sars-cov-2-pandemic-1st-snakes-then-pangolins-now-stray-dogs-52477/", "region": "Research"},

The app transmits and captures random Bluetooth signals via nearby cell phones that also have the app installed. App users who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 voluntarily and anonymously report their positive results, which then causes their Bluetooth pings from the last 14 days to be uploaded to a database that\u2019s coded to ensure that the diagnosed user is uploading their own pings. From there, those signals are compared with pings of other app participants in the system. The app then alerts users of possible proximity to an infected person, and subsequently directs them to follow up with health officials (or their doctor). All of the uploaded information is verified by a public health agency, and all apps must be installed by users voluntarily.", "For Canetti, Trachtenberg, and Varia, the main concern of the technology is the preservation of privacy. \u201cThe question of privacy originally came up in a discussion on the mailing list of the BU Hariri Institute\u2019s Cyber Security, Law, and Society Alliance,\u201d says Trachtenberg, a professor of electrical and computer engineering. \u201cI proposed a [prototypic] approach to privacy-aware contact tracing, and Ran, Mayank, and I fleshed out the approach in a paper that we posted to arXiv on March 27.\u201d", "The arXiv paper attracted a great deal of attention, and the BU team soon joined the\u00a0", "\u00a0team, which is led by Ron Rivest, an MIT professor and the inventor of several highly regarded encryption algorithms.", "\u201cPACT was started in response to COVID-19,\u201d says Varia. \u201cThis is just one small piece of the COVID-19 puzzle; there exist an immense number of healthcare issues and also many technological ones that PACT does nothing to address.

Until an effective vaccine or treatment is available the coronavirus can only be halted by enabling people to take more control over their lives, individually and collectively, and on a global scale. In an infectious disease outbreak, the first enemy is time. Most governments have responded quickly to enforce lock-downs and to use communication and moral suasion to influence individual risk behaviours such as social distancing. The outbreak response has been driven by data, by difficult political decisions and to some extent, by what works in public health. In truth, we have underestimated COVID-19 which has overwhelmed healthcare systems and has pushed hard working health professionals to the limit. The pressure has revealed gaps in risk communication, community involvement, protective equipment, critical care and testing.", "COVID-19 is \u2018Disease X\u2019, a relatively unknown pathogen leading to a pandemic, originating as a zoonotic virus and with a high rate of infection. Similar disease outbreaks include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2018. All have occurred in Asia and have resulted from the sale and preparation of wild animals under unregulated and/or insanitary conditions, creating an opportunity for the transmission of a virus (Laverack, 2018). Why have international public health authorities continued to allow these conditions to persist?\u00a0 The real surprise about COVID-19 has been the rapid spread and severity, leaving us unable to predict how it will develop within societies. The nature of COVID-19 has created a sense of fear and a need to act urgently and without precedent. Some decisions will leave behind long-lasting human and economic costs that will be deeply felt in society. Next time, if we can choose, will we want to use such draconian measures to halt the outbreak or will we choose to use a more nuanced public health response?", "There is not a single model for communication and community engagement during a pandemic. Each country must develop its own approach based on the strengths and weaknesses of its socio-cultural, political, economic, infrastructural and historical context. Some socio-cultural contexts, for example, can tolerate long-term lock-downs whilst others will resist, especially as life becomes increasingly more difficult. What works in some countries has to be treated with caution because it may not be possible to replicate in other countries.", "Governments have not widely used community-centred approaches, although there is no excuse not to actively involve people in an outbreak response. The emphasis has been on individual compliance and, in particular, on strict population control measures. Health promotion has an important role in changing behaviours such as hand-washing as well as to strengthen community involvement. Communities can monitor the everyday movement of people in a given locality such as a neighbourhood, a village or across borders. Community self-management can ensure compliance with the requirements of a lock-down by helping others to understand the consequences of their actions and to report violations or suspected cases (Laverack and Manoncourt, 2015). Lock-downs have a greater chance of success if people are enabled to take more control and responsibility and are motivated by a sense of altruism, rather than by imposing punishment for violations. In the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in West Africa, non-compliant behaviours were observed during lock-downs, sometimes made worse by poor service delivery, weak information flow and a lack of government support to the vulnerable. The situation worsened as the lock-downs continued, often in specific localities and attempts by the security forces to coerce communities to comply were counterproductive and led to mistrust and escalated resistance (Laverack, 2018, Chapter 9).", "The protection of the vulnerable in society has not been fully addressed during the pandemic including refugees and migrants, the socially isolated, the homeless, elderly people in residencies, the mentally ill and women and children at risk from domestic violence. People who are vulnerable and who suffer inequality will be more adversely affected by COVID-19. Similarly, those countries with the greatest inequalities will potentially be more adversely affected by COVID-19. Overcrowded and slum conditions with insufficient water supply and poor sanitation and a high population density deny the opportunity for proper hygiene and social distancing. The local administrative and enforcement authorities, health agencies and communities must work together to address an outbreak but small gains have been made on how to reach slum communities, with no clear strategy for cooperation, engagement and communication (Laverack, 2018a).", "The mobilization of volunteers during the pandemic by non-government agencies, universities and community-based organisations has provided much needed support for, example, to deliver essential items, for making face masks and checking on vulnerable people. The usual social support network of friends and family is broken during a lock-down and people within apartment blocks, neighbourhoods and villages have had to help one another. However, altruism has not been universal, with some localities being better organised and more supportive than others. The pre-planning for, and the support of, community based organisations and voluntary support networks by the government is good practice because this provides a link between people affected by COVID-19 and services. However, the support should be systematic to ensure that all vulnerable people are helped during an outbreak.", "Health promotion activities must be maintained during a pandemic to support a healthy physical, mental and spiritual lifestyle, especially during confinement. Places of worship have been closed, despite the ease of social distancing, and people are leading stressful and sedentary lives. Promoting a healthy lifestyle would include reinforced messaging about healthy eating and activity levels, stress reduction and safe alcohol and tobacco use at home. It is also important that information is made available about ongoing prevention programs such as vaccination and screening and for online and telephone services to cope with stress and domestic violence. In West Africa, untreated malaria cases and unvaccinated children for diseases such as measles were estimated to have led to the death of more people than the actual Ebola Virus Disease outbreak (Roberts, 2015). Health promotion messaging can also help to counter false information and rumours, to reduce stigma and to mitigate public mistrust about public health services.", "Communities must be an intrinsic part of an outbreak response including during the exit strategy from lock-downs. Everyone must be actively involved in order for the response to be successful. Community engagement and communication are two important approaches that can enable people to take more control of their lives and health. However, communities and community-based organisations must receive government resources to strengthen social networks and local capacity to address an outbreak. Not to do so is questionable and the reasons for not actively involving communities in an outbreak response must be assessed, including any assumptions about weak local competencies and the lack of trust between government and civil society.", "\u00a0", "Laverack, G.

Recreating those masks exactly proved too difficult. So instead, the team created a two-part solution: a 3D printed mask that can be cleaned and reused that will work in tandem with a 3D printed disposable filter cartridge. Alternatively, the filter cartridge could be used with an adapted hospital mask.", "Joshua Kim, senior designer and program coordinator in the Department of Surgery Human-Centered Design Program, said he was inspired by the NASA engineers during the Apollo 13 disaster, who quickly devised a makeshift carbon dioxide removal system from materials on hand inside the lunar module, including duct tape and plastic.", "\u201cHow can we utilize materials that people can get at a local hardware store and repurpose those materials to make protective equipment?\u201d he asked.", "The \u201c95\u201d in N95 means these masks filter 95% of particulates of a certain size, he explained. HEPA filters, like those used in air purifiers, filter around 99% of particulates. So he bought a HEPA filter and set about experimenting. Using the same testing that\u2019s used on N95 masks, he found that using those filters in the homemade cartridge did work \u2013 a positive sign that they were on the right track.", "Meanwhile, another group was working on creating the masks. Dentists Walter Renne, D.M.D., and Christian Brenes Vega, D.D.S., regularly use 3D printing. \u201cIt\u2019s just a part of the job,\u201d said Renne, who estimated that 20% of dentists and 90% of dental labs have a 3D printer on hand. They enlisted the help of John Yost, a student and independent contractor who serves as a resource for all things associated with 3D printing on campus.", "A team at MUSC developed a DIY protective mask that anyone with a 3D printer can copy.", "Initially, they developed different prototypes that would work with different types of filters, including filters used by painters or people dealing with asbestos. They 3D scanned a mask to get the basic shape, then designed modifications so the mask could accommodate the disposable filter cartridge. The filter, noted Brenes Vega, is the most important part. Unfortunately, some people have turned to masks that aren\u2019t actually offering protection, he said.", "Finally, they needed to solve the problem of releasing air pressure, Kim said. The filters are so effective that when the wearer exhales, the air will go to the area of least resistance to escape \u2013 in other words, not through the filter again but by causing the mask to lift slightly off the wearer\u2019s face. That exposes the wearer to the outside air and renders the mask worthless, Renne said. In response, the team installed a rubber valve, commonly used in other medical applications, that allows the exhaled air to escape the mask. As soon as the wearer inhales, the valve immediately shuts, Kim said, protecting the wearer.", "Kim said that, for additional sealing and comfort, they added strips of neoprene weatherstripping foam around the edges of the mask. The foam provides a comfortable fit so the wearer\u2019s skin isn\u2019t touching the plastic mask and ensures it contours to the face as the wearer moves or talks.", "With all the parts in place \u2013 the 3D printed mask and 3D printed cartridge fitted with a hand-cut HEPA filter and rubber valve \u2013 the group began fit-testing.", "They took four prototypes to the Emergency Department and tested them on several users. So far, the masks have fit everyone, Yost said, although they want to expand their testing to include more face sizes and shapes.", "The team is already printing masks at MUSC, even as they continue to perfect the design.", "The biggest obstacle now is the time it takes to create the masks. MUSC\u2019s 3D printers aren\u2019t production-level printers. They\u2019re meant for creating prototypes when time isn\u2019t of the essence.

That\u2019s important to know from a public health standpoint, and for understanding what\u2019s going on with marine mammal populations that aren\u2019t thriving.\u201d", "Despite their name, herring worms can be found in a variety of marine fish and squid species. When people eat live herring worms, the parasite can invade the intestinal wall and cause symptoms that mimic those of food poisoning, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In most cases, the worm dies after a few days and the symptoms disappear. This disease, called anisakiasis or anisakidosis, is rarely diagnosed because most people assume they merely suffered a bad case of food poisoning, Wood explained.", "After the worms hatch in the ocean, they first infect small crustaceans, such as bottom-dwelling shrimp or copepods. When small fish eat the infected crustaceans, the worms then transfer to their bodies, and this continues as larger fish eat smaller infected fish.", "Humans and marine mammals become infected when they eat a fish that contains worms. The worms can\u2019t reproduce or live for more than a few days in a human\u2019s intestine, but they can persist and reproduce in marine mammals.", "Seafood processors and sushi chefs are well-practiced at spotting the worms in fish and picking them out before they reach customers in grocery stores, seafood markets or sushi bars, Wood explained. The worms can be up to 2 centimeters in length, or about the size of a U.S. 5-cent nickel.", "\u201cAt every stage of seafood processing and sushi preparation, people are good at finding worms and removing them from fish,\u201d Wood said.", "Some worms can make it past these screening steps. Still, Wood \u2014 who studies a range of marine parasites \u2014 said she enjoys eating sushi regularly. For sushi consumers who remain concerned about these worms, she recommends cutting each piece in half and looking for worms before eating it.", "For the analysis, the study\u2019s authors searched the published literature archived online for all mentions of Anisakis worms, as well as another parasitic worm called Pseudoterranova, or \u201ccod worm.\u201d They whittled down the studies based on set criteria, ultimately keeping only those studies that presented estimates of the abundance of each worm in fish at a given point in time. While Anisakis worms increased 283-fold over the study period of 1978 to 2015, Pseudoterranova worms did not change in abundance.", "Although the health risks of these marine worms are fairly low for humans, scientists think they may be having a big impact on marine mammals such as dolphins, whales and seals. The worms actually reproduce in the intestines of these animals and are released into the ocean via the marine mammals\u2019 feces. While scientists don\u2019t yet know the physiological impacts of these parasites on marine mammals, the parasites can live in the mammals\u2019 bodies for years, which could have detrimental effects, Wood said.", "\u201cOne of the important implications of this study is that now we know there is this massive, rising health risk to marine mammals,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIt\u2019s not often considered that parasites might be the reason that some marine mammal populations are failing to bounce back. I hope this study encourages people to look at intestinal parasites as a potential cap on the population growth of endangered and threatened marine mammals.\u201d", "The authors aren\u2019t sure what caused the large increase of Anisakis worms over the past several decades, but climate change, more nutrients from fertilizers and runoff, and an increase in marine mammal populations over the same period could all be potential reasons, they said.", "Marine mammals have been protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act since 1972, which has allowed many populations of seals, sea lions, whales and dolphins to grow. Because the worms reproduce inside marine mammals \u2014 and their rise occurred over the same time period as the mammals\u2019 increase \u2014 this is the most plausible hypothesis, Wood said.", "\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the recovery of some marine mammal populations has allowed recovery of their Anisakis parasites.\u201d Wood said. \u201cSo, the increase in parasitic worms actually could be a good thing, a sign that the ecosystem is doing well. But, ironically, if one marine mammal population increases in response to protection and its Anisakis parasites profit from that increase, it could put other, more vulnearble marine mammal populations at risk of increased infection, and that could make it even more difficult for these endangered populations to recover.\u201d", "\n"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/anisakis-parasite-283-fold-increase-in-abundance-since-the-1970s-93758/", "region": "Research"},

Garry, of Tulane University; Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney; Andrew Rambaut, of University of Edinburgh; W. Ian Lipkin, of Columbia University.", "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging widely in severity. The first known severe illness caused by a coronavirus emerged with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China. A second outbreak of severe illness began in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).", "On December 31 of last year, Chinese authorities alerted the World Health Organization of an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus causing severe illness, which was subsequently named SARS-CoV-2. As of February 20, nearly 167,500 COVID-19 cases have been documented, although many more mild cases have likely gone undiagnosed. The virus has killed over 6,600 people.", "Shortly after the epidemic began, Chinese scientists sequenced the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and made the data available to researchers worldwide. The resulting genomic sequence data has shown that Chinese authorities rapidly detected the epidemic and that the number of COVID-19 cases have been increasing because of human to human transmission after a single introduction into the human population. Andersen and collaborators at several other research institutions used this sequencing data to explore the origins and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 by focusing in on several tell-tale features of the virus.", "The scientists analyzed the genetic template for spike proteins, armatures on the outside of the virus that it uses to grab and penetrate the outer walls of human and animal cells. More specifically, they focused on two important features of the spike protein: the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a kind of grappling hook that grips onto host cells, and the cleavage site, a molecular can opener that allows the virus to crack open and enter host cells.", "The scientists found that the RBD portion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins had evolved to effectively target a molecular feature on the outside of human cells called ACE2, a receptor involved in regulating blood pressure. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was so effective at binding the human cells, in fact, that the scientists concluded it was the result of natural selection and not the product of genetic engineering.", "This evidence for natural evolution was supported by data on SARS-CoV-2\u2019s backbone \u2013 its overall molecular structure. If someone were seeking to engineer a new coronavirus as a pathogen, they would have constructed it from the backbone of a virus known to cause illness. But the scientists found that the SARS-CoV-2 backbone differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins.", "\u201cThese two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its distinct backbone, rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2\u201d said Andersen.", "Josie Golding, PhD, epidemics lead at UK-based Wellcome Trust, said the findings by Andersen and his colleagues are \u201ccrucially important to bring an evidence-based view to the rumors that have been circulating about the origins of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19.\u201d", "\u201cThey conclude that the virus is the product of natural evolution,\u201d Goulding adds, \u201cending any speculation about deliberate genetic engineering.\u201d", "Based on their genomic sequencing analysis, Andersen and his collaborators concluded that the most likely origins for SARS-CoV-2 followed one of two possible scenarios.", "In one scenario, the virus evolved to its current pathogenic state through natural selection in a non-human host and then jumped to humans. This is how previous coronavirus outbreaks have emerged, with humans contracting the virus after direct exposure to civets (SARS) and camels (MERS). The researchers proposed bats as the most likely reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, as it is very similar to a bat coronavirus. There are no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, however, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved between bats and humans.", "In this scenario, both of the distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s spike protein\u2014the RBD portion that binds to cells and the cleavage site that opens the virus up\u2014would have evolved to their current state prior to entering humans. In this case, the current epidemic would probably have emerged rapidly as soon as humans were infected, as the virus would have already evolved the features that make it pathogenic and able to spread between people.", "In the other proposed scenario, a non-pathogenic version of the virus jumped from an animal host into humans and then evolved to its current pathogenic state within the human population. For instance, some coronaviruses from pangolins, armadillo-like mammals found in Asia and Africa, have an RBD structure very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2. A coronavirus from a pangolin could possibly have been transmitted to a human, either directly or through an intermediary host such as civets or ferrets.", "Then the other distinct spike protein characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, the cleavage site, could have evolved within a human host, possibly via limited undetected circulation in the human population prior to the beginning of the epidemic. The researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 cleavage site, appears similar to the cleavage sites of strains of bird flu that has been shown to transmit easily between people. SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved such a virulent cleavage site in human cells and soon kicked off the current epidemic, as the coronavirus would possibly have become far more capable of spreading between people.", "Study co-author Andrew Rambaut cautioned that it is difficult, if not impossible, to know at this point which of the scenarios is most likely. If the SARS-CoV-2 entered humans in its current pathogenic form from an animal source, it raises the probability of future outbreaks, as the illness-causing strain of the virus could still be circulating in the animal population and might once again jump into humans. The chances are lower of a non-pathogenic coronavirus entering the human population and then evolving properties similar to SARS-CoV-2."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/the-covid-19-coronavirus-epidemic-has-a-natural-origin-scientists-say-86240/", "region": "Headlines"},
