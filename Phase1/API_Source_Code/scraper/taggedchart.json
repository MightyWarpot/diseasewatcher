It is not just going to happen of its own accord,\u201d says Professor Shekhawat. \u201cIt can be self-inflicted, through exposure to extreme loud music, for example, or industrial noise \u2013 and that once the tiny hairs on the cochlear in the inner ear are damaged, even the slightest bit, they can never be regenerated. It is a sense lost forever \u2013 and that changes people\u2019s perception once they understand that.\u201d", "Professor Shekhawat says the importance of conquering the tinnitus problem is more fundamental than most people realise. \u201cWhen a baby is conceived, the first sensory system to develop is hearing.

The mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is the main malaria mosquito in India but only appeared on the African continent a few years ago. It has now been found in cities and towns in urban settings in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Djibouti. Researchers from the Radboud university medical center and the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Ethiopia showed that the invading mosquito species is highly susceptible to local malaria strains. Malaria can therefore become an increasing problem for urban areas in Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa.", "In Africa, malaria is traditionally been a rural disease with towns and cities associated with much lower levels or absence of malaria. This is due to the fact that most African malaria mosquitoes breed in rural areas. However, the introduction of Anopheles stephensi may increase the malaria risk for urban populations. Over recent years there have been increasing reports of the Asian mosquito species Anopheles stephensi in the Horn of Africa. Anopheles stephensi can reproduce particularly well in man-made containers with clean water. This makes Anopheles stephensi a notorious mosquito species for urban malaria", "A mosquito species only poses a health risk if it can spread local malaria parasites. \u201cThat is why we performed mosquito feeding experiments with the blood of Ethiopian malaria patients. This allowed us to determine whether the local malaria parasite can develop in the new mosquito,\u201d explains Professor of Epidemiology of Tropical Infectious Diseases Teun Bousema of Radboud university medical center in Nijmegen. \u201cTo our surprise, the Asian mosquito turned out to be even more susceptible to local malaria parasites than our Ethiopian mosquito colony. This mosquito appears to be an extremely efficient spreader of the two main species of malaria\u201d.", "With this important puzzle piece, concerns about urban malaria in Africa are increasing. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) already sounded the alarm about the possible consequences of the invasion of Anopheles stephensi in Africa. With this new findings, these concerns seem justified. \u201cAn aggressive approach to target this mosquito is now a top priority,\u201d concludes dr. Fitsam Tadesse. \u201cOnly if we act quickly can we prevent the spread to other urban areas on the continent. We must target the mosquito larvae in places where they now occur and prevent mosquitoes from spreading over long distances, for example via airports and sea ports. If that fails, the risk of urban malaria will rise in large parts of Africa.\u201d", "With approximately 216 million cases and 400,000 deaths per year, malaria is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time. Compared to the situation before the year 2000, there is a clear decrease in the number of sick people, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Unfortunately, malaria now seems to be on the rise in several areas where it was previously under control. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the main types of malaria for humans. They are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and vice versa. There are about 60 mosquito species that can transmit human malaria. In Africa, a number of mosquito species are traditionally responsible for the most malaria transmission. Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes have been labeled the most dangerous animal species on earth and are especially common in rural settings in Africa. Spraying with Insecticides and the use of impregnated mosquito netting against mosquitoes are among the most effective ways to combat malaria. Since 2015, a vaccine has been registered for use. This vaccine, Mosquirix, offers some protection against Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the deadliest form of malaria.

Like other hantaviruses, Andes virus infection can lead to a severe and often fatal respiratory disease in humans, called Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). Importantly, Andes virus is the only hantavirus known to spread person to person. Those who come into direct contact with an infected individual or their body fluids, or who spend time in close proximity to an ill person, may also become infected.

Understanding which genomic \u201csignatures\u201d correspond to the mechanisms necessary for person-to-person transmission may help scientists to develop new therapeutics to treat Andes virus infection.", "Researchers found that droplets or aerosolized viral particles may have been routes of infection during the extensive person-to-person transmission of the 2018-2019 outbreak. They also noted that symptoms presented anywhere between 9 and 40 days after the infection took place. However, the authors pointed out that there might be a narrow window of infectiousness. Transmission often occurred on the first day of fever presentation in an infected patient. Interestingly, there was no clear association between the individuals transmitting the virus and their disease severity.", "\u201cThis important observation indicates that, regardless of the severity of the disease, all HPS cases should be equally managed concerning their potential for virus transmission,\u201d said Gustavo Palacios, Ph.D., co-senior author of the paper and Division Chief of Molecular Biology at USAMRIID. \u201cFurthermore, we need to re-evaluate the threat that this virus poses. The lack of existing medical countermeasures, super-spreading potential, and high case-fatality rate all should raise concern.\u201d", "These findings could potentially help clinicians and public health officials deal with future outbreaks. As with the preventive measures currently being practiced for COVID-19, social distancing and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment were effective in controlling transmission. Moreover, widespread contact tracing and self-quarantining led to a detectable decrease in transmission.", "\u201cAlthough less than 10 percent of cases occurred in hospital settings, the threat to clinicians and hospital staff must not be underestimated,\u201d said Valeria Martinez, Ph.D., of ANLIS, co-first author of the study. \u201cDoctors should remember that in the 1996 outbreak, many health care personnel got sick, and some died, when the appropriate personal protective equipment was not used.\u201d", "According to the authors, the study also examined cytokines within patients to determine the types of immunological responses present in people with HPS caused by Andes virus. Cytokines are proteins that aid cell-to-cell communication in immune responses.

Prior to that, the only record of the disease was a small cluster and a single confirmed case in 2004 in Bolivia\u2019s Chapare Province, about 370 miles east of La Paz. The recent outbreak surprised health authorities, since initially all they knew was that it was a hemorrhagic fever that produced symptoms similar to diseases such as Ebola. It sparked a rapid mobilization of infectious disease experts from Bolivia\u2019s Ministry of Health, the CDC and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to explore the origins of the disease, including securing samples from patients and developing a new diagnostic test.", "\u201cOur work confirmed that a young medical resident, an ambulance medic and a gastroenterologist all contracted the virus after encounters with infected patients\u2014and two of these healthcare workers later died,\u201d said Caitlin Cossaboom, DVM, PhD, MPH, an epidemiologist with the CDC\u2019s Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. \u201cWe now believe many bodily fluids can potentially carry the virus.\u201d", "Cossaboom said the confirmation of human-to-human transmission shows healthcare providers and anyone else dealing with suspected cases must take extreme care to avoid contact with items that may be contaminated with blood, urine, saliva or semen. For example, there is evidence that the medical resident who died from the disease may have been infected while suctioning saliva from a patient. The ambulance medic who was infected, but survived, was likely infected when he resuscitated the same medical resident as she was being transported to the hospital after she fell ill. Researchers also detected viral RNA in the semen of one survivor 168 days after infection, which also raises the possibility of sexual transmission. Further investigation is necessary to learn about other potential routes of transmission.", "Chapare belongs to a group of viruses called\u00a0arenaviruses.

Like those pathogens, Chapare virus can cause hemorrhagic fevers\u2014a condition also seen in Ebola patients that can produce severe problems across multiple organs, leaving patients struggling to survive.

There is\u00a0no specific treatment, so patients are treated mainly with intravenous fluids and other supportive care.", "There is still much that remains unknown about Chapare virus, chiefly where it originated, how it infects humans, and the likelihood of larger outbreaks in Bolivia and elsewhere in South America. Cossaboom presented new evidence of Chapare viral RNA detected in rodents collected from an area around the home and nearby farmlands of the first patient identified in the 2019 outbreak\u2014an agriculture worker who also died.

She said that when it became clear the illness was not caused by dengue, patient samples collected by Bolivian authorities were quickly dispatched to a highly secure biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) CDC laboratory. Once there, they were subjected to analysis with advanced next generation genome sequencing technology. CDC experts were able to identify the virus as Chapare because it matched sequence data derived from the patient involved in the original 2004 infection.", "\u201cWe isolated the virus, and we were expecting to find a more common disease, but the sequence data pointed to Chapare virus,\u201d Morales-Betoulle said. \u201cWe were really surprised because the 2019 outbreak in La Paz occurred long after the first case was identified in 2004.\u201d", "Morales-Betoulle said that the availability of new sequencing tools allowed CDC experts to rapidly develop an RT-PCR test for detecting Chapare\u2014the same type of test often used to diagnose COVID-19, which is considered the gold standard for diagnostics. The investigation then moved back to CENETROP in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, where there is a BSL-3 lab and team capable of securing and analyzing patient samples.", "She said several collaborators on the team involved in the Chapare response already were in South America investigating other viral hemorrhagic fevers when the 2019 outbreak occurred.", "\u201cThat allowed us to mobilize and move really quickly,\u201d she said.", "\n", "Morales-Betoulle and Cossaboom said future work will focus on using the diagnostic tests to conduct surveillance to identify additional human infections and field work to determine whether rodents are involved in spreading the disease.

Approximately 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The trial is continuing to enroll and is expected to continue through the final analysis when a total of 164 confirmed COVID-19 cases have accrued. The study also will evaluate the potential for the vaccine candidate to provide protection against COVID-19 in those who have had prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, as well as vaccine prevention against severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the primary efficacy endpoints evaluating confirmed COVID-19 cases accruing from 7 days after the second dose, the final analysis now will include, with the approval of the FDA, new secondary endpoints evaluating efficacy based on cases accruing 14 days after the second dose as well.\u00a0 The companies believe that the addition of these secondary endpoints will help align data across all COVID-19 vaccine studies and allow for cross-trial learnings and comparisons between these novel vaccine platforms.

However, a small fraction of adult donors, about 1 in 20, also had antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2, and this was not dependent on recent infection with a common cold coronavirus.", "Notably, such cross-reactive antibodies were found much more frequently in blood samples taken from children aged 6 to 16.", "Kevin Ng, lead author and post-graduate student in the Retroviral Immunology Laboratory at the Crick says: \u201cOur results show that children are much more likely to have these cross-reactive antibodies than adults. More research is needed to understand why this is, but it could be down to children being more regularly exposed to other coronaviruses.", "\u201cThese higher levels we observed in children could also help explain why they are less likely to become severely ill with COVID-19. There is no evidence yet, however, that these antibodies prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or spread.\u201d", "In the lab, the researchers tested the antibodies they found in blood from uninfected people to confirm they are able to neutralise SARS-CoV-2. They found the cross-reactive antibodies target the S2 subunit of the spike protein on the surface of the virus.", "George Kassiotis, senior author and group leader of the Retroviral Immunology Laboratory at the Crick says: \u201cThe spike of this coronavirus is made of two parts or subunits, performing different jobs. The S1 subunit allows the virus to latch onto cells and is relatively diverse among coronaviruses, whereas the S2 subunit lets the virus into cells and is more similar among these viruses. Our work shows that the S2 subunit is sufficiently similar between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 for some antibodies to work against both.", "\u201cIt was previously thought that only antibodies to the S1 could block infection, but there is now good evidence that some antibodies to S2 can be just as effective. This is exciting as understanding the basis for this activity could lead to vaccines that work against a range of coronaviruses, including the common cold strains, as well as SARS-CoV-2 and any future pandemic strains.", "\u201cBut it is important to stress that there are still many unknowns which require further research.

Neighborhood transmission is an important consideration for COVID-19 even if older people can and do self-isolate, because many of them will come into contact with working age people at some point. Close exposure to working age-individuals in the form of care workers or other household members puts older people at risk, so strategies to protect these people must be explored, with particular attention to densely populated areas.\u201d", "Living arrangements, the type of home, and neighborhood characteristics are considered to be important aspects in understanding the spread of COVID-19 among older adults, but previous research has relied on aggregated data and not considered individual risk factors. In this first of its kind study, individual patient data was used to evaluate how residential context was related to COVID-19 mortality among older adults in Stockholm, Sweden.", "In the observational study, researchers used data from the cause-of-death register held by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare to identify COVID-19 mortality, and mortality from other causes among people aged 70 years and over in Stockholm between 12 March and 8 May 2020.", "During the study period, there were 3,386 deaths, 1,301 were reported as COVID-19 related. They linked five variables to find out how many COVID-19 deaths were associated with each. The variables included how crowded the housing was (m2 per individual), the household age structure (living alone, living with at least one individual aged 66 years or over, and living with at least one individual younger than 66 years), house type (single-family detached house, multi-family housing such as apartment buildings and care homes), neighborhood population density, and confirmed cases in the area.", "The researchers then adjusted these numbers for other factors that could influence COVID-19 mortality (age, sex, education, income, and country of birth) and created a model to calculate the difference in risk of dying from COVID-19 associated with the five variables. They also compared these figures to mortality from other causes of death to see which factors were exclusively associated with COVID-19. This comparison allowed the researchers to highlight which residential conditions were particularly relevant risk factors for COVID-19, rather than being general risk factors for the elderly.", "When looking at living arrangements, those in care homes had the highest mortality (233 deaths per 1,000 people per year), followed by those living in apartment blocks (26 deaths per 1,000 people per year), and those living in a detached house (16 deaths per 1,000 people per year). After adjusting for age, sex, education, income, and country of birth, individuals living in care homes were four times as likely to die of COVID-19 compared to those living in independent housing.", "In terms of household age structure, the lowest COVID-19 mortality was found among older people who lived with someone aged 66 or older (19 deaths per 1,000 people per year), while the highest mortality was found in homes with at least one person older the 66 years of age and one child younger than 16 years of age (38 deaths per 1,000 people per year in homes). After adjustment, living with someone who is working age (younger than 66 years old) was associated with a 60% increase in COVID-19 mortality, compared with living in a household with individuals aged 66 years or older.", "Living in the most densely populated neighborhoods (more than 5,000 individuals per km2) had the highest mortality (39 deaths per 1,000 people per year), compared to neighborhoods of less than 150 individuals per km2 (11 deaths per 1,000 people per year). After adjustment, older people living in the most densely populated neighborhoods (more than 5,000 individuals per km2) were at a 70% higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than the least populated areas.", "All factors were exclusively associated with COVID-19 except when it came to living in the most crowded homes, which was also associated with an increase of mortality of other causes of death. Living in the most crowded homes (0m2 to <20 m2 per individual) had the highest mortality (73 deaths per 1,000 people per year), compared to the least crowded homes (22 deaths per 1,000 people per year). After adjustment, those living in the most crowded households were twice as likely to die of COVID-19, as well as other causes, than those living in the least crowded homes.", "The researchers say the higher associated risk of COVID-19 mortality when living with a younger person suggests that multigenerational living could contribute to COVID-19 mortality in countries where it is common and community transmission remains high. They warn that measures to protect the elderly must also focus on reducing community transmission, as well as individual points of transmission. For example, individuals of working age or younger who live with or are in frequent contact (i.e., care home workers) with the elderly must have access to adequate PPE or resources allowing them to mitigate the spread of the virus.", "Additionally, self-isolating and making use of services such as online shopping and doctors\u2019 appointments, both common practices in Stockholm, may have allowed older people to successfully shield, reflected in the lower rates of mortality when living with someone aged 66 years and older. There was a lack of PPE equipment in care homes at the beginning of the pandemic, which could have contributed to the higher risk of mortality when living in a care home, the researchers suggest.", "The authors note some limitations to their study. The findings might not be applicable to other contexts, as older people in Sweden seem to live in the community more than in other countries, so they say that only the frailest would have been in care homes. They add that the data could have underestimated the amount of people living in care homes because the frailest sometimes die before their move into the care home has been registered.

CJD is the most common form of a human disorder caused by \u201cprions,\u201d pathogenic agents that induce abnormal folding of specific cellular proteins in the brain called \u201cprion proteins.\u201d The major type of CJD, accounting for 85% of the cases, is called sporadic CJD (sCJD). Because sCJD mainly occurs in late-middle old age, an increase in the aging population worldwide can potentially cause a rise in CJD cases, which is a pressing global concern. Thus, to help policymakers plan ahead and establish a robust strategy, it is essential to estimate the trends of CJD-associated deaths and incidence.", "To this end, a team of researchers at Okayama University, including Dr Yoshito Nishimura, Dr Toshihiro Koyama, and Dr Hideharu Hagiya, conducted a trend analysis of the incidence and mortality of CJD in Japan, between 2005 and 2014.

Our aim was to analyze these trends, in an effort to spread awareness and spur new treatment strategies.\u201d", "For their analysis, the scientists used national vital statistics data on CJD-associated deaths among individuals aged over 50 years as well as the government-funded nationwide CJD surveillance data (from 2005 to 2014) in Japan. Their analysis revealed that, from 2005 to 2014, there was a significant increase in the absolute number of deaths, mortality rates, and incidence rates associated with CJD, even after adjusting for age. In particular, the average increase in incidence was estimated to be 6.4% per year. This trend in CJD-associated mortality and incidence rates was especially prominent in the older-age group, particularly in those over the age of 70 years. Although a previous report by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease International Surveillance Network had stated that annual death rates of sCJD had risen in most participating countries in the past two decades, this study shows that Japan might have had higher CJD-associated deaths and incidence than other countries, which the scientists attributed to a rise in the aging population.

Parts of the HA stem, on the other hand, very rarely mutate.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t understand the complete picture yet, but for many reasons, the immune system is intrinsically not good at seeing the conserved parts of these proteins, which if effectively targeted would elicit an antibody response that would neutralize multiple influenza types,\u201d Lingwood says.", "In their new study, the researchers set out to study why the immune system ends up targeting the HA head rather than the stem, and to find ways to refocus the immune system\u2019s attention on the stem. Such a vaccine could elicit antibodies known as \u201cbroadly neutralizing antibodies,\u201d which would respond to any flu strain. In principle, this kind of vaccine could end the arms race between vaccine designers and rapidly mutating flu viruses.", "One factor that was already known to contribute to antibody preference for the HA head is that HA proteins are densely clustered on the surface of the virus, so it\u2019s difficult for antibodies to access the stem region. The head region is much more accessible.", "The researchers developed a computational model that helped them to further explore the \u201cimmunodominance\u201d of the protein\u2019s head region. \u201cWe hypothesized that the surface geometry of the virus could be key to its ability to survive by protecting its vulnerable parts from antibodies,\u201d Amitai says.", "The researchers explored the effects of geometry on immunodominance using a technique called molecular dynamics simulation. They further modeled a process called antibody affinity maturation. This process, which occurs after B cells encounter a virus (or a vaccine), determines which antibodies will predominate during the immune response.", "Each B cell has on its surface proteins called B cell receptors, which bind to different foreign proteins. Once a particular B cell receptor binds strongly to the HA protein, that B cell becomes activated and starts to multiply rapidly. This process introduces new mutations into the B cell receptors, some of which bind more strongly. These better binders tend to survive, while the weaker binders die. At the end of this process, which takes one or two weeks, there is a population of B cells that is very good at binding strongly to the HA protein. These B cells secrete antibodies that bind to the HA protein.", "\u201cAs time goes on, after infection, the antibodies get better and better at targeting this particular antigen,\u201d Chakraborty says.", "The researchers\u2019 computer simulations of this process revealed that when a typical flu vaccine is given, B cell receptors that bind strongly to the HA stem are at a competitive disadvantage during the maturation process, because they can\u2019t reach their targets as easily as B cell receptors that bind strongly to the HA head.", "The researchers also used their computer model to simulate this maturation process with a nanoparticle vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health, which is now in a phase 1 clinical trial. This particle carries HA stem proteins spaced out at lower density. The model showed that this arrangement makes the proteins more accessible to antibodies, which are Y-shaped, allowing the antibodies to grab onto the proteins with both arms. The simulations revealed that those stem-targeting antibodies predominated at the end of the maturation process.", "Refocused immunity", "The researchers also used their computational model to predict the outcome of several possible vaccination strategies. One strategy that appears promising is to immunize with an HA stem from a virus that is similar to, but not the same as, strains that the recipient has previously been exposed to. In 2009, many people around the world were either infected with or vaccinated against a novel H1N1 strain. The modeling led the researchers to hypothesize that if they vaccinated with nanoparticles displaying HA-like proteins from a strain that is different from the 2009 version, it should elicit the kind of broadly neutralizing antibodies that may confer universal immunity.", "Using mice with human immune cells, the researchers tested this strategy, first immunizing them against the 2009 H1N1 strain, followed by a nanoparticle vaccine carrying the HA stem protein from a different H1N1 strain. They found that this approach was much more successful at eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies than any of the other strategies that they tested.", "\u201cWe discovered that this particular event in our immune history can actually be harnessed with this particular nanoparticle to refocus the immune system\u2019s attention on one of these so-called universal vaccine targets,\u201d Lingwood says. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a refocusing event, that means we can swing the antibody response against that target, which under other conditions is simply not seen. We have shown in previous studies that when you\u2019re able to elicit this kind of response, it\u2019s protective against flu strains that mimic pandemic threats.\u201d", "\n"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/mit-researchers-working-on-universal-flu-vaccine-70502/", "region": "Vaccines", "disease": "MIT", "location": "unknown"}, {"title": "\r\n        Japan records more than 4,000 syphilis cases in 1st 9 months of 2020        ", "date": "October 11, 2020", "body": ["By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0", "Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo has reported 4,168 syphilis cases through September 30.

In the case of flaviviruses, however, if a person gets a second flavivirus infection \u2013 they were originally infected with Zika and then got dengue, for instance \u2013 the presence of antibodies can result in more severe symptoms through a process called antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.", "\u201cIf, at some point in the past you\u2019ve had Zika virus, later when you are exposed to dengue, you are at much greater risk of getting sick.

Hepcludex is a first-in-class entry inhibitor for the treatment of hepatitis D and prevents hepatitis D and B viruses (HDV/HBV) from entering liver cells. The development of this new drug brings new hope to approximately 25 million people in the world suffering from hepatitis D infection, as no other approved drug has been available to treat this infectious disease up to now. Hepatitis D virus infections are a particularly severe form of viral hepatitis as they only occur as co-infections with HBV and lead to an accelerated progression of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. To date, liver transplants have been the only chance of survival for many patients.", "\u201cWe are very pleased about this success which is based on decades of virology research in Heidelberg,\u201d notes Prof. Hans-Georg Kr\u00e4usslich, spokesman of the Center of Infectious Disease Research at the UKHD and Chairman of the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF). \u201cThis drug was developed in close collaboration between partners in science, public funders and a biotech company and is therefore an epitome of successful translation of laboratory results into clinical application.\u201d", "Hepcludex\u2019s mechanism of action is based on a lock-and-key principle: Hepatitis B and D viruses exclusively replicate in the liver as they require the bile acid transporter NTCP to do so, which is only found on liver cells. They use this transporter like the \u2018lock\u2019 (virus receptor) through which they enter the cell. Hepcludex blocks this lock, acting like a broken key that is stuck in the lock. However, Hepcludex also works after an infection has occurred and the virus has already entered the cell, why is this so? \u201cThe virus continually needs to infect healthy liver cells in order to persist, as the infected ones either die or are eliminated by the immune system,\u201d says Prof. Stephan Urban. Over the course of 25 years of research, Urban and his team developed Hepcludex and, since his appointment as a DZIF professor in 2014, have focussed on developing the drug. \u201cLiver cells evidently divide very rapidly when the liver is infected. The drug then protects the new, regenerated liver cells from infection whilst the infected cells are eliminated,\u201d explains Stephan Urban. Several phase I and II clinical trials showed that humans tolerate the agent well and that it efficiently prevents the replication of hepatitis B and D viruses. A phase III trial is currently being conducted, investigating Hepcludex\u2019s long-term effects, amongst other things.", "The research was initially funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), which provided 2.4 million euros for the preclinical development through the funding programme \u201cInnovative Therapies\u201d. As of 2014, the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), which was founded in 2012, joined in and has been financing Stephan Urban\u2019s professorship at the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg, amongst other projects.", "When molecular biologist Stephan Urban started his research in a small laboratory, he did not have the development of a drug for hepatitis D in mind \u2013 he was initially interested in a different virus and was looking for the site used by hepatitis B viruses to enter liver cells. Many researchers across the globe where involved in this mission, which Urban called the \u201cHoly Grail of hepatitis research\u201d because hepatitis B is so widespread. This formed the starting point of their meticulous work: They first had to find a way of propagating the virus in cell cultures so that its replication process could be studied. The second step involved determining the correct receptor from a large number of candidates. \u201cWe used parts of the viral envelope sequence to generate protein fragments that mimick a part of the natural viral envelope, which we added to non-infected liver cells to see if we could inhibit viral entry,\u201d says Urban. They finally made a discovery:", "The virus used a bile salt transporter, the NTCP receptor (NTCP: sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide), to enter the cell like a stowaway. Virions, i.e. infectious virus particles outside of the host cell, are unable to enter the cell when this transporter is blocked by these synthetically produced protein fragments. Blocking just some of the receptors is enough to prevent virions from entering. \u201cOur clinical studies show that Hepcludex is effective in very low concentrations, so that bile salt transporters can continue to operate for the cell,\u201d Urban summarises.", "Hepatitis D infection only occurs as an HBV co-infection because the D virus is unable to produce its own viral envelope. Instead, like a parasite of a parasite, it uses parts of the B virus to enter the liver cell. Effective but non-curative treatments for hepatitis B exist and with this small protein fragment, Urban and his team had now created the first effective hepatitis D drug in the world. Subsequently, Hepcludex was granted PRIME scheme eligibility by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). PRIME is short for \u201cPriority Medicines\u201d and was launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. On 28 May 2020, EMA recommended Hepcludex for approval and the European Commission has now approved it for prescription in Europe.", "Heidelberg\u2019s success story continues beyond the approval of Hepcludex for the treatment of hepatitis D. A few years ago, at the same institute, a pivotal contribution was made towards the development of hepatitis C drugs. Using information discovered about hepatitis C\u2019s molecular characteristics and replication cycle, Prof. Ralf Bartenschlager, Director of the UKHD Department of Infectious Diseases, Molecular Virology, elicited sites that could be targeted for developing antivirals. He has been accompanying and supporting Stephan Urban\u2019s research for many years: \u201cViral hepatitis in its different forms poses an immense global public health problem,\u201d says Bartenschlager. He congratulates Stephan Urban\u2019s team for their success and also adds some food for thought with regard to research funding in Germany. \u201cI would wish for more consistent and long-term government funding for projects that are transitioning from basic research to the development of clinical applications, so that in future, promising projects no longer fail at the stage of finding funders.\u201d In his view, a positive example is the Trans regional Research Centre (TRR) 179 \u201cDeterminants and Dynamics of Elimination versus Persistence of Hepatitis Virus Infection\u201d at the Medical Faulty of Heidelberg, which he heads. It is being funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and is currently in a second period of funding with approximately 13 million euro. This strengthens Heidelberg as a hepatitis research site. The DZIF was also founded with the specific aim of translating anti-infective agents into clinical applications.", "There are comparatively few people suffering from hepatitis D infection in Germany. A part of the reason for this is that many people are vaccinated against hepatitis B through which they are also protected against hepatitis D. \u201cThe Robert Koch Institute estimates that approximately 240,000 people in Germany suffer from chronic HBV infection. We expect that approximately 2.5 percent of these people are co-infected with HDV, which corresponds to approximately 6,000 people,\u201d says Stephan Urban. \u201cHowever, we do not have precise figures as many people with HBV infection have not been additionally tested for hepatitis D.\u201d Prof. Uta Merle, Acting Medical Director of the Clinic for Gastroenterology, Infectious Diseases and Poisoning at the UKHD, treated several hepatitis D patients within clinical trials and underlines the implications of having a new agent: \u201cChronic infections with hepatitis D are particularly aggressive and difficult to treat. Patients with chronic hepatitis D often develop hepatic restructuring through to liver cirrhosis within five to ten years of infection. This severe course is observed in 70 to 90 percent of HDV infections including those in young people. At the stage of liver cirrhosis and its complications, a liver transplant is the only treatment option,\u201d she summarises. This most severe form of hepatitis is particularly widespread in Africa, South America, Mongolia, Russia and Eastern Europe and many are unaware of their infection because of a lack of testing methods. For this reason the drug was approved in Russia and the former Soviet Union under the brand name Myrcludex at the end of 2019.", "The Medical Faculty of Heidelberg and the French state research institution INSERM (Institut national de la sant\u00e9 et de la recherche m\u00e9dicale) granted the licence for Hepcludex to the independent biotech company MYR Pharmaceuticals GmbH. The French involvement resulted from previous collaborations between Urban and INSERM researchers, based upon which the basic patent for the further development of Hepcludex at the Heidelberg Campus was created. Potential gains from the licence go to the institutions in charge (Heidelberg University, INSERM, DZIF), the developer Stephan Urban, other researchers at the hospital involved in the development, as well as the Department of Molecular Virology.", "As hepatitis B viruses also use the bile salt transporter NTCP to enter cells, Hepcludex is also an effective treatment for hepatitis B. Meanwhile, the agent has also been tested in combination with the immune modulator interferon alpha (IFN?), which is approved for hepatitis B, with very successful results. \u201cAfter 48 weeks of treatment, the viral loads significantly decreased and all viral markers consistently disappeared in some of the patient,\u201d says Stephan Urban. However, as established treatment for hepatitis B already exist, the prerequisites for fast track approval for HBV monoinfection were not met which is why Hepcludex can initially only be used for patients who are particularly severely affected by dual infections. \u201cIn future, it will be very interesting to examine whether a combination of Hepcludex and an immune modulator can also cure HBV patients who are not co-infected with HDV,\u201d says Stephan Urban."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/hepatitis-d-drug-hepcludex-receives-approval-by-the-european-commission-79168/", "region": "Drugs and antibiotics", "disease": "Hepatitis D", "location": "Heidelberg"}, {"title": "\r\n        Norway: COVID-19 on MS Roald Amundsen voyages, 53 people with confirmed infection        ", "date": "August 5, 2020", "body": ["By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0", "The National Institute of Public Health in Norway is reporting a total of 53 people with confirmed COVID-19 infection on two voyages of the\u00a0Hurtigruten vessel, MS Roald Amundsen.", "The two voyages around Svalbard with boarding and disembarking in Troms\u00f8 occurred on 17-24 July and 24-31 July.", "Of the 53 cases, 37 were detected in crew and 16 in passengers.

Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Program in Rwanda (Rwanda Biomedical Center), the World Health Organization (WHO), Cochin Hospital and Columbia University (New York, USA), recently detected the emergence and spread of malaria parasites capable of resisting artemisinin derivatives for the first time in Rwanda. The results of the research were published on August 3, 2020 in\u00a0", ".", "Malaria, caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, represents a major public health problem. Almost 3.2 billion people (virtually half the world\u2019s population) in 89 countries are at risk of contracting the disease, for which there is currently no vaccine. Every year, over 200 million cases and over 400,000 deaths are recorded.", "For more than 15 years, treatment of malaria episodes (typical cycles of the disease alternating between fever, shivering and chills, and severe sweating) caused by Plasmodium falciparum has depended on artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which combine a fast-acting artemisinin derivative and a partner drug with a long half-life. Since 2008, parasites capable of resisting artemisinin derivatives in South-East Asia (Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos) have become increasingly prevalent. This resistance, which leads to a delay in the clearance of parasites from the bloodstream of individuals treated with an ACT, is currently a serious threat that may hinder efforts to tackle the disease. A major concern is that these resistant parasites will spread through Sub-Saharan Africa, the continent most affected by malaria (>90% of cases), as was the case with previous generations of antimalarial treatments (chloroquine and folic acid antagonists). In the 1980s, the reduced efficacy of chloroquine is thought to have contributed to several million additional deaths from malaria in young African children.", "Since 2014, the geographical distribution of artemisinin resistance has been monitored based on the detection of mutations in the Kelch13 gene in parasites. These mutations are believed to reduce the function of the Kelch13 protein, thought to be involved in hemoglobin degradation in infected red blood cells. Currently, the most widespread resistant parasites in South-East Asia have the C580Y mutation. Recently, C580Y mutant parasites have also been detected in Guyana and Papua New Guinea. In Africa, where ACTs remain very effective, Kelch13 mutant parasites have remained rare. For instance, the KARMA study, the first global map of artemisinin resistance, showed that less than 5% of African samples had mutations and that more than 50% of the mutants detected had only been observed once. Scientists also demonstrated that the most frequently observed mutation in Africa (A578S) did not confer artemisinin resistance to gene-edited Asian parasites.", "Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, involved in a WHO-supported project on molecular monitoring of resistance in Africa, recently identified the first signs of emergence of artemisinin-resistant Kelch13 mutant parasites in Africa. The results describe significant proportions of parasites carrying the R561H mutation in two locations 100km apart (prevalences of 7.4% in Masaka and 0.7% in Rukara, respectively). Whole-genome sequencing of these parasites indicates that the R561H mutants were selected from Rwandan parasite populations and that they had not spread from Asian parasites (from Thailand or Myanmar, where the R561H mutation has previously been observed). \u201cThese unexpected results contrast with previous scenarios in which the emergence of chloroquine- or pyrimethamine-resistant parasites in Africa was caused by the spread of resistant parasites from South-East Asia. It was thought that a similar scenario would apply for the emergence of artemisinin-resistant parasites in Africa,\u201d explains Didier M\u00e9nard, Head of the Malaria Genetics and Resistance Unit at the Institut Pasteur. The fact that this resistant strain has spread between several places in Rwanda and its ability to resist artemisinin in vitro have major public health implications. In the absence of effective measures to contain the spread of resistant parasites in Rwanda and neighboring countries, there is a risk that over time they will acquire the ability to resist the partner drugs used in ACTs. This would mean that the only available treatments would become ineffective, as has occurred in South-East Asia. A model of this scenario, in which no measures are taken, recently predicted that the inefficacy of ACTs in Africa could be responsible for 78 million additional cases and 116,000 additional deaths over a five-year period."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/malaria-artemisinin-resistant-strain-reported-in-rwanda-84139/", "region": "Africa", "disease": "Malaria", "location": "Rwanda"}, {"title": "\r\n        Minnesota reports 23% increase in syphilis, congenital syphilis cases up 110%        ", "date": "August 6, 2020", "body": ["By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0", "Minnesota state health officials reported an increase in sexually transmitted infections in 2019, according to their annual STD surveillance report.", "While cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea both increased by 4 and 7 percent, respectively, of special concern were 1,127 syphilis cases reported in 2019, a 23% increase from 2018.", "The past few years have shown a marked increase in syphilis cases in Minnesota as well as across the United States.

In order to obtain an effective therapy for COVID-19 as quickly as possible, drugs that are being used to treat other diseases are currently being repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. The Infection Biology Unit of the German Primate Center (DPZ) \u2013 Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in G\u00f6ttingen, together with colleagues at the Charit\u00e9 in Berlin, was able to show that the malaria drug chloroquine, which has been demonstrated to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 infection of African green monkey kidney cells, is not able to prevent infection of human lung cells with the novel coronavirus. Chloroquine is therefore unlikely to prevent the spread of the virus in the lung and should not be used for the treatment of COVID-19 (", ").", "It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is able to use two different routes to enter cells. First, after attaching to the cells, the virus can fuse directly with the plasma membrane and introduce its genetic material into the host cell. Second, it can enter the interior of the cells upon uptake via transport structures, called endosomes. In both cases, the attachment of the virus to the cells and subsequent entry is mediated by the viral spike protein. For this purpose, the spike protein must be activated either by the enzyme cathepsin L (in endosomes) or by the enzyme TMPRSS2 (on the cell surface). Depending on the cell type, both enzymes or only one of them can be available for activation.", "Chloroquine is a drug that is used to treat malaria. Since chloroquine inhibits the infection of monkey kidney cells with SARS-CoV-2, chloroquine has been tested in clinical trials as a possible candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. However, how chloroquine inhibits the infection of monkey kidney cells was not clear. The current study shows that chloroquine inhibits viral entry into these cells, most likely by blocking cathepsin L activity. This raised the question whether chloroquine also inhibits the infection of lung cells that are known to produce TMPRSS2 but only a small amount of cathepsin L.", "The study shows that chloroquine does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry into human lung cells and subsequent spread of the virus in these cells. \u201cIn this study, we show that the antiviral activity of chloroquine is cell type-specific and that chloroquine does not block the infection of lung cells.

As standard clinical practice in the U.S., they explain, patients who are thought to have this infection are typically treated first with the broad spectrum antibiotic ceftriaxone while they wait for a microbiology lab to identify the causative organism from blood or cerebrospinal fluid samples. Once the organism is identified as N meningitidis, patients are typically treated with penicillin or ampicillin, antibiotics with a narrower spectrum of activity that\u2019s less likely to lead to ceftriaxone resistance.

Their model assumes that the spread of COVID-19 in African countries will be similar to other countries that were affected earlier in the pandemic and were unable to control the virus. It assumes around 60% of the population will become infected and that the potential disruption to health services will last for six months.", "Exact data on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with routine clinic trips for childhood immunisations were not available, so the model was based on assumptions relating to the likely number of people encountered during such a journey, both at the clinic itself as well as during travel there and back again. Risks to the child, accompanying adult and any household members were taken into account. The model also accounted for the household size and age composition in each country, as risk of death from COVID-19 is known to substantially increase with age.", "\n", "The researchers based their estimates of the number of childhood deaths that could be prevented by routine immunisations on existing health data from each country. They focused on the impact of vaccines for diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterial causes of pneumonia and meningitis), rotavirus, measles, rubella, meningitis A and yellow fever. Vaccination rates for each country were assumed to be the same as in 2018.", "According to the model, continuing with routine immunisation programmes may lead to 8,300 additional deaths across Africa (uncertainty interval 1,300 to 25,000), attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with children visiting immunisation clinics.", "However, suspending such vaccination programmes to avoid excess COVID-19 deaths could lead to 702,000 children across Africa dying from preventable diseases before the age of five (uncertainty interval 635,000 and 782,000), according to the model. The researchers say this scenario assumes no catch-up vaccination campaigns at the end of the COVID-19 risk period and may overestimate the negative impact of suspending vaccination services for a short period of time.", "Even in a much more conservative scenario (where suspending vaccination is primarily assumed to increase the chance of a local measles outbreak and children would be protected from other diseases from existing immunity in the population or catch-up immunisation campaigns at the end of the COVID-19 risk period), the number of childhood deaths that could be prevented was still greater than the potential increase in COVID-19 deaths for most countries of Africa.", "Dr Tewodaj Mengistu, co-author of the study, from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Switzerland, said: \u201cRoutine immunisation programmes are facing enormous disruption across the globe due to this pandemic. Lockdowns make it harder for vaccinators and parents to reach vaccination sessions, health workers are being diverted to COVID-19 response, and misinformation and fear are keeping parents away. This important study shows just how big an impact this could have, risking the resurgence of diseases that vaccines have kept largely at bay.\u201d", "Findings were similar for all 54 countries of Africa, ranging from between 4 and 124 preventable child deaths in Morocco to between 28 and 598 in Angola, for each excess COVID-19 death. One third of vaccine-preventable deaths would be in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, the study found. Around one third of vaccine-preventable deaths would be caused by measles, and another third would be attributable to pertussis, according to the model.", "While the study clearly shows the health benefits of vaccination for children, it revealed that the additional risk of COVID-19 infections acquired during visits to the clinic would primarily affect adults from the same household. According to the model, 11% of excess COVID-19 deaths attributable to clinic visits are expected to affect parents or adult carers and 88% are predicted to affect older adults living in the same household as the vaccinated children. The researchers say this highlights the importance of shielding older adults to lower their risk of acquiring COVID-19, while children in their households can benefit from routine vaccinations.", "Dr Stefan Flasche, senior author of the study, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK, said: \u201cWe found that the biggest factors affecting the benefit of maintaining childhood immunisations during the pandemic are the likelihood of transmission of COVID-19 during clinic visits and the number of people encountered at the clinic. This highlights the need for personal protective equipment for clinic staff, the need to implement physical distancing measures and avoid crowded waiting rooms, and the importance of good hygiene practices to reduce virus transmission.\u201d", "The authors acknowledge that other factors must be considered when making decisions on sustaining routine childhood immunisation programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite their structural similarities, in vitro, hydroxychloroquine appears to be more effective. In addition, when used for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, hydroxychloroquine has fewer side effects, less drug interactions and is less toxic in overdose. The authors note that the currently available evidence is restricted to eight published studies, five on hydroxychloroquine alone; two on hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin; and one on both in combination or alone.

A total of 23 healthy trial volunteers were vaccinated twice with MVA-MERS-S, the experimental vaccine, with an interval of four weeks between the vaccinations. The trial was to answer two questions: Is the experimental vaccine MVA-MERS-S tolerated well and safe to use in humans? Does it trigger humoral and cellular immune responses in humans, i.e. a development of antibodies and T cells that are able to prevent MERS-CoV infection or curb the course of illness?", "\u201cThe tolerability and safety of the vaccine candidate as well as the resulting immune responses are very promising,\u201d explains Dr Till Koch, one of the first authors of the trial and a DZIF stipend-holder. The vaccine was well tolerated. Local side effects (i.e. pain at the site of injection, mild erythema and warmth) occurred most frequently and presented in 69 percent of the trial subjects. No severe side effects occurred. \u201cAfter the second injection of MVA-MERS-S, antibody formation and T cell responses occurred in 87 percent of the trial subjects,\u201d summarises first co-author Dr Christine Dahlke.", "Prof. Stephan Becker is pleased, \u201cThese results show that the new vaccine could potentially be used in future MERS outbreaks.\u201d The trial subjects\u2019 antibody responses were investigated in his laboratory at the University of Marburg. At the DZIF, Stephan Becker coordinates the research area \u201cEmerging Infections\u201d and is substantially involved in all vaccine projects.", "Next, a phase Ib trial, funded by CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic preparedness Innovation), will be conducted in which the vaccine will be tested in 160 trial subjects in Hamburg and Rotterdam. At the German Center for Infection Research, the results and tests from this trial will be used to start the development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus as rapidly as possible. The scientists will use the same viral vector (MVA) into which they will insert a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to replace the MERS-CoV spike protein.", "\n"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/mers-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-in-humans-promising-26128/", "region": "Vaccines", "disease": "Diseases at the UKE", "location": "unknown"}, {"title": "\r\n        SARS-CoV-2 vaccine progress moving rapidly: Flinders University        ", "date": "April 5, 2020", "body": ["South Australian researchers working with Oracle Cloud technology and vaccine technology developed by local company Vaxine Pty Ltd are testing a vaccine candidate against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The team is headed by Nikolai Petrovsky, Flinders University Professor and Research Director at Vaxine.", "His team has tapped Oracle for technical collaboration, access to an expanded research community, and cloud infrastructure that helped enable the rapid design of the novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate.", "\u201cThe vaccine has progressed into animal testing in the US and, once we confirm it is safe and effective, will then be advanced into human trials,\u201d says Professor Petrovsky \u2013 stressing expectations shouldn\u2019t be elevated until all testing is completed.", "The latest cloud-based technology provided by Oracle enabled the team to \u201cdramatically speed up our ability to analyse the COVID-19 virus and use this information to design the vaccine candidate\u201d.", "\u201cAs soon as the genomic sequence of COVID-19 became available in January, we immediately used this, combined with our previous experience in developing a SARS coronavirus vaccine, to characterise the key viral attachment molecule called the spike protein,\u201d Professor Petrovsky says.", "\u201cWe used computer models of the spike protein and its human receptor, ACE2, to identify how the virus was infecting human cells, and then were able to design a vaccine to block this process,\u201d he says.", "Flinders University Associate Professor Dimitar Sajkov, a respiratory physician in South Australia, has been involved in conducting previous human trials of the team\u2019s pandemic vaccines and hopes to similarly lead clinical trials of this new COVID-19 vaccine candidate.", "\u201cThe team has exploited the very latest technologies, including AI, advanced manufacturing and Cloud computing to accelerate vaccine design, shaving years off normal development timeframes,\u201d Professor Sajkov says.", "\u201cWe achieved great results with Vaxine\u2019s swine flu vaccine developed during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, where we commenced clinical trials of a vaccine within 3 months of discovery of the virus.\u00a0 We hope to achieve similar results with their COVID-19 vaccine candidate when it is ready for human testing\u201d he says."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/sars-cov-2-vaccine-progress-moving-rapidly-flinders-university-98181/", "region": "Australia", "disease": "COVID-19", "location": "Vaxine"}, {"title": "\r\n        Philippines COVID-19 update: Chinese medical experts arrived in Manila        ", "date": "April 5, 2020", "body": ["By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0", "Philippines health officials\u00a0 report in an update today that the COVID-19 case count has risen to 3246, including 152 deaths.", "Of the total confirmed cases across the country, more than half are reported from from the National Capital Region (NCR).", "The Department of Health announced twelve Chinese medical experts arrived in Manila today to share their learnings in handling COVID-19 cases with\u00a0 Filipino medical professionals.", "However, Duque clarified that their tasks will be purely advisory. \u201cIt is really guiding how to improve, level-up our COVID-19 response, learn different levels of surveillance, risk-assessment, isolation strategies, detection through accurate testing, clinical case management, and non-pharmaceutical public health measures,\u201d he added.", "The Chinese medical experts, together with DOH staff, are scheduled to visit RITM, the Lung Center of the Philippines, San Lazaro Hospital and quarantine facilities to train Filipino medical professionals.

Quarantine can be prolonged for some people who have a worse case of the illness, and can impose significant economic, emotional, and psychological hardship on the patient and his or her family. Family members living with a quarantined COVID-19 patient are at high risk of getting the disease themselves. In order to be released from quarantine, they must meet certain criteria according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC): patients must go 72 hours without a fever, see their symptoms improve, and go seven days since their symptoms first appeared. The primary goal of PATCH sub-study 1 is to find out whether the drug reduces the number of days the patient stays quarantined. Researchers were forced to overcome unique logistical hurdles, including arranging for virtual consents from patients and home delivery of HCQ doses.", "The second sub-study of the trial will test HCQ in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 to see if it can reduce the time to discharge. Patients in this group will also be randomized into a high dose or low dose group. No one will receive a placebo. The correct dose of HCQ for treating COVID-19 is not currently known and this study will provide valuable information to answer that question. The third sub-study will test whether HCQ can work as a preventative medicine to stop infection in health care workers at risk of exposure to COVID-19. Researchers plan to enroll 200 workers in the sub-study.", "\u201cThe need for the third sub-study here is critical, as we try to keep the people working on the front lines of this pandemic healthy so they can continue to keep the nation\u2019s health care infrastructure up and running,\u201d Abella said.", "Given the rapid spread of the virus, researchers had to work quickly not only to organize the trial and get it approved from a regulatory standpoint, but also to solve practical problems.

Until an effective vaccine or treatment is available the coronavirus can only be halted by enabling people to take more control over their lives, individually and collectively, and on a global scale. In an infectious disease outbreak, the first enemy is time. Most governments have responded quickly to enforce lock-downs and to use communication and moral suasion to influence individual risk behaviours such as social distancing. The outbreak response has been driven by data, by difficult political decisions and to some extent, by what works in public health. In truth, we have underestimated COVID-19 which has overwhelmed healthcare systems and has pushed hard working health professionals to the limit. The pressure has revealed gaps in risk communication, community involvement, protective equipment, critical care and testing.", "COVID-19 is \u2018Disease X\u2019, a relatively unknown pathogen leading to a pandemic, originating as a zoonotic virus and with a high rate of infection. Similar disease outbreaks include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2013related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2018. All have occurred in Asia and have resulted from the sale and preparation of wild animals under unregulated and/or insanitary conditions, creating an opportunity for the transmission of a virus (Laverack, 2018). Why have international public health authorities continued to allow these conditions to persist?\u00a0 The real surprise about COVID-19 has been the rapid spread and severity, leaving us unable to predict how it will develop within societies. The nature of COVID-19 has created a sense of fear and a need to act urgently and without precedent. Some decisions will leave behind long-lasting human and economic costs that will be deeply felt in society. Next time, if we can choose, will we want to use such draconian measures to halt the outbreak or will we choose to use a more nuanced public health response?", "There is not a single model for communication and community engagement during a pandemic. Each country must develop its own approach based on the strengths and weaknesses of its socio-cultural, political, economic, infrastructural and historical context. Some socio-cultural contexts, for example, can tolerate long-term lock-downs whilst others will resist, especially as life becomes increasingly more difficult. What works in some countries has to be treated with caution because it may not be possible to replicate in other countries.", "Governments have not widely used community-centred approaches, although there is no excuse not to actively involve people in an outbreak response. The emphasis has been on individual compliance and, in particular, on strict population control measures. Health promotion has an important role in changing behaviours such as hand-washing as well as to strengthen community involvement. Communities can monitor the everyday movement of people in a given locality such as a neighbourhood, a village or across borders. Community self-management can ensure compliance with the requirements of a lock-down by helping others to understand the consequences of their actions and to report violations or suspected cases (Laverack and Manoncourt, 2015). Lock-downs have a greater chance of success if people are enabled to take more control and responsibility and are motivated by a sense of altruism, rather than by imposing punishment for violations. In the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in West Africa, non-compliant behaviours were observed during lock-downs, sometimes made worse by poor service delivery, weak information flow and a lack of government support to the vulnerable. The situation worsened as the lock-downs continued, often in specific localities and attempts by the security forces to coerce communities to comply were counterproductive and led to mistrust and escalated resistance (Laverack, 2018, Chapter 9).", "The protection of the vulnerable in society has not been fully addressed during the pandemic including refugees and migrants, the socially isolated, the homeless, elderly people in residencies, the mentally ill and women and children at risk from domestic violence. People who are vulnerable and who suffer inequality will be more adversely affected by COVID-19. Similarly, those countries with the greatest inequalities will potentially be more adversely affected by COVID-19. Overcrowded and slum conditions with insufficient water supply and poor sanitation and a high population density deny the opportunity for proper hygiene and social distancing. The local administrative and enforcement authorities, health agencies and communities must work together to address an outbreak but small gains have been made on how to reach slum communities, with no clear strategy for cooperation, engagement and communication (Laverack, 2018a).", "The mobilization of volunteers during the pandemic by non-government agencies, universities and community-based organisations has provided much needed support for, example, to deliver essential items, for making face masks and checking on vulnerable people. The usual social support network of friends and family is broken during a lock-down and people within apartment blocks, neighbourhoods and villages have had to help one another. However, altruism has not been universal, with some localities being better organised and more supportive than others. The pre-planning for, and the support of, community based organisations and voluntary support networks by the government is good practice because this provides a link between people affected by COVID-19 and services. However, the support should be systematic to ensure that all vulnerable people are helped during an outbreak.", "Health promotion activities must be maintained during a pandemic to support a healthy physical, mental and spiritual lifestyle, especially during confinement. Places of worship have been closed, despite the ease of social distancing, and people are leading stressful and sedentary lives. Promoting a healthy lifestyle would include reinforced messaging about healthy eating and activity levels, stress reduction and safe alcohol and tobacco use at home. It is also important that information is made available about ongoing prevention programs such as vaccination and screening and for online and telephone services to cope with stress and domestic violence. In West Africa, untreated malaria cases and unvaccinated children for diseases such as measles were estimated to have led to the death of more people than the actual Ebola Virus Disease outbreak (Roberts, 2015). Health promotion messaging can also help to counter false information and rumours, to reduce stigma and to mitigate public mistrust about public health services.", "Communities must be an intrinsic part of an outbreak response including during the exit strategy from lock-downs. Everyone must be actively involved in order for the response to be successful. Community engagement and communication are two important approaches that can enable people to take more control of their lives and health. However, communities and community-based organisations must receive government resources to strengthen social networks and local capacity to address an outbreak. Not to do so is questionable and the reasons for not actively involving communities in an outbreak response must be assessed, including any assumptions about weak local competencies and the lack of trust between government and civil society.", "\u00a0", "Laverack, G.

This is how previous coronavirus outbreaks have emerged, with humans contracting the virus after direct exposure to civets (SARS) and camels (MERS). The researchers proposed bats as the most likely reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, as it is very similar to a bat coronavirus. There are no documented cases of direct bat-human transmission, however, suggesting that an intermediate host was likely involved between bats and humans.", "In this scenario, both of the distinctive features of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s spike protein\u2014the RBD portion that binds to cells and the cleavage site that opens the virus up\u2014would have evolved to their current state prior to entering humans. In this case, the current epidemic would probably have emerged rapidly as soon as humans were infected, as the virus would have already evolved the features that make it pathogenic and able to spread between people.", "In the other proposed scenario, a non-pathogenic version of the virus jumped from an animal host into humans and then evolved to its current pathogenic state within the human population. For instance, some coronaviruses from pangolins, armadillo-like mammals found in Asia and Africa, have an RBD structure very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2. A coronavirus from a pangolin could possibly have been transmitted to a human, either directly or through an intermediary host such as civets or ferrets.", "Then the other distinct spike protein characteristic of SARS-CoV-2, the cleavage site, could have evolved within a human host, possibly via limited undetected circulation in the human population prior to the beginning of the epidemic. The researchers found that the SARS-CoV-2 cleavage site, appears similar to the cleavage sites of strains of bird flu that has been shown to transmit easily between people. SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved such a virulent cleavage site in human cells and soon kicked off the current epidemic, as the coronavirus would possibly have become far more capable of spreading between people.", "Study co-author Andrew Rambaut cautioned that it is difficult, if not impossible, to know at this point which of the scenarios is most likely. If the SARS-CoV-2 entered humans in its current pathogenic form from an animal source, it raises the probability of future outbreaks, as the illness-causing strain of the virus could still be circulating in the animal population and might once again jump into humans. The chances are lower of a non-pathogenic coronavirus entering the human population and then evolving properties similar to SARS-CoV-2."], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/the-covid-19-coronavirus-epidemic-has-a-natural-origin-scientists-say-86240/", "region": "Headlines", "disease": "unknown", "location": "unknown"}, {"title": "\r\n        Spain COVID-19 cases top 11,000, 1 million masks distributed        ", "date": "March 17, 2020", "body": ["By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0", "Spain\u2019s Ministry of Health reported another 2,000 COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the country total to 11,178.", "The coronavirus related fatalities close in on 500 with 491 officially reported.", "Madrid and Catalonia account for more than 6,000 of Spain\u2019s cases.", "The Ministry of Health also reported that they started\u00a0the distribution of more than a million surgical masks among the Autonomous Communities.\u00a0Madrid is the community that will receive the greatest number because it is also the region with the highest number of positives.", "This afternoon a cargo plane from Shanghai (China) arrived at Zaragoza airport with 500,000 masks that have been donated and will be distributed in the next few hours.\u00a0In addition, between yesterday and today, other items have been distributed that, in total, add up to 546,000 more masks.", "Likewise, the Ministry of Health maintains a centralized purchase of all kinds of sanitary material to face the fight against the coronavirus.", " will close its borders to all non-essential travel as it attempts to contain the\u00a0ongoing spread of the coronavirus\u00a0on the continent.", "\n"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/spain-covid-19-cases-top-11000-1-million-masks-distributed-81857/", "region": "Europe", "disease": "COVID-19", "location": "Spain"}, {"title": "\r\n        Poison Control Centers: Fielding calls on everything from snakebites to coronavirus        ", "date": "March 17, 2020", "body": ["This week,\u00a0", "Podcast: ", " | ", "Subscribe: ", " | ", " | ", " | ", "\n"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/poison-control-centers-fielding-calls-on-everything-from-snakebites-to-coronavirus-17645/", "region": "Outbreak News Interviews", "disease": "snakebites", "location": "unknown"}, {"title": "\r\n        Venezuela: President Maduro announces country enters \u2018social quarantine\u2019, 33 positive cases of COVID-19        ", "date": "March 17, 2020", "body": ["By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0", "A total of 33 positive cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) are registered in Venezuela, after 16 new infections were confirmed this Monday.", "\u201cAll cases are imported: 28 are from Europe and five from C\u00facuta (Colombia).\u00a0Of the 33 cases, 18 are women and 15 are men, \u201cstated the President of the Republic, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, from the Miraflores Palace, located in Caracas.", "He explained that the cases are distributed among Caracas (8), Miranda (13), La Guaira (5), Aragua (2), Anzo\u00e1tegui (2), M\u00e9rida (1), Cojedes (1) and Apure (1).\u00a0Of these, 31 are residents and 2 are foreign citizens, including a diplomatic representative of a South American nation.", "Regarding the age range of COVID-19 carriers, he explained that two cases are between 10-19 years old;\u00a0seven between 20-29 years;\u00a011 between 30-39 years;\u00a0four between 40-49 years;\u00a0five between 50-59 years;\u00a0three between 60-69 years and one between 70-79 years.", "The first two cases of Coronavirus in Venezuela were registered on March 13, thereafter 31 new cases of contagion have been confirmed.", "Maduro also announced\u00a0that \u201cstarting Tuesday, March 17, the entire Venezuela enters a social quarantine.\u201d", "\u201cThe entire country, the 23 states and the Capital District, all to collective quarantine, a drastic and necessary measure,\u201d emphasized the President.", "The head of state urged \u201cthe governors, governors, mayors, mayors, military chiefs of the Integral Defense Regions, of the Integral Defense Zones, Integral Defense Areas, the country\u2019s health authorities, chiefs and heads of the Areas of Comprehensive Health, the Bolivarian National Militia, the country\u2019s social, professional, scientific, military and police force, to go to this total quarantine. \u201d", "\u00a0", "\u00a0"], "url": "http://outbreaknewstoday.com/venezuela-president-maduro-announces-country-enters-social-quarantine-33-positive-cases-of-covid-19-56236/", "region": "Headlines", "disease": "COVID-19", "location": "Venezuela"}, {"title": "\r\n        Puerto Rico reports 5 COVID-19 cases, Curfew imposed        ", "date": "March 17, 2020", "body": ["By NewsDesk\u00a0\u00a0", "On Sunday, Puerto Rico Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez announced that a curfew will be put in place on the island from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. daily until at least March 30.
