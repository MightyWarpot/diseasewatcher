In 2015, the mcr-1 gene was discovered in China and subsequently identified in other countries including Denmark, Germany, Vietnam, Spain, and the USA among others [1], raising fears that bacteria may acquire combined colistin and carbapenem resistance, making them multi-drug resistant.', 'Two studies published today come at an important time in China. Colistin, which has been used extensively in farming in China since the 1980s, was recently banned for use in agriculture, and will soon be introduced in clinical use for the first time.', 'The first study, led by Professor Timothy Walsh at Cardiff University (UK) and Professor Jianzhong Shen at the China Agricultural University, looked at the prevalence of bacteria carrying the mcr-1 resistance gene in human infections in two hospitals in Zheijang and Guangdong provinces across 8 years. Among more than 17000 bacterial isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76/5332 samples of E coli and 13/348 samples of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study is the first to look at risk factors for clinical mcr-1 infection and found that people who had used antibiotics (particularly carbapenems) before hospitalisation were more likely to carry bacteria with the mcr-1 resistance gene. Among 146 isolates of mcr-1-positive E coli identified, only five were also carbapenem resistant.', '“The emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, such as colistin. The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily. Our study finds that there are significant risk factors for the spread of mcr-1 infections, beyond just rural living and diet. The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,” says Professor Tim Walsh [2].', 'The second study, led by researchers at Zhejiang University (China), tested samples from over 2000 bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China. Of the 1495 E coli samples, 20 were mcr-1 positive, one of which was also carbapenem resistant. Patients with mcr-1-positive infections were all treated successfully with other antibiotics.', '“The most troubling problem for clinicians would be the transfer of colistin resistance to a bacterium which is already carbapenem resistant, making it multi-drug resistance. This does not appear to have happened to any great extent in clinical isolates, but the situation should be monitored carefully as the country prepares to introduce colistin for use in humans,” says Professor Yunsong Yu, Zhejiang University [2].', 'Discussing the findings from both papers in a linked Comment, Professor David Paterson, University of Queensland (Australia) and Associate Professor David van Duin, University of North Carolina (US) write: “at this stage we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via mcr-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China. However, prior use of carbapenems was a risk factor for mcr-1 producing E coli, perhaps implying that the intersection between carbapenem resistance and the presence of this colistin resistance mechanism may yet be seen in the future. Furthermore, the spread of mcr-1 into globally widespread and virulent strains of E coli such as ST-131 is cause for ongoing concern and surveillance.', 'He adds: “After carbapenems, new antibiotics will become available for clinical use in human medicine in China. There are risks that low-cost generic copies of these new antibiotics will be used in agriculture. We must be vigilant to this possibility and urge Chinese authorities to proactively prohibit use of these critical antibiotics outside of appropriate human use. Without such interventions, there will doubtless be more serious problems than mcr-1 seen in China in the near future.”']}, {'title': 'PLAGUE in China: An update and review', 'date': 'December 2, 2019', 'location': 'China', 'region': 'Asia', 'url': 'http://outbreaknewstoday.com/plague-in-china-an-update-and-review-39580/', 'disease': 'unknown', 'body': ['By NewsDesk\xa0\xa0', 'According to Chinese officials, there has been 5 human plague cases in China in 2019.', 'In this video, the third on this topic in less than a month, I look at the case from Gansu that occurred in September but wasn’t reported on any meaningful scale.', 'I also look at the most recent case out of Inner Mongolia–the 5th case.', 'There are issues with the rat population in Inner Mongolia, and I look at some reporting on that.

The disease is spread by direct contact or through respiratory droplets. It is characterized by the appearance on the skin and mucous membranes of successive crops of lesions that are easily broken and become scabbed. Varicella usually affects children and is relatively benign, but complications may arise in the form of pneumonia and encephalitis. After infection, the virus may be reactivated and develop into herpes zoster, commonly known as “shingles,” in older adults.']}, {'title': 'PLAGUE in China: An update and review', 'date': 'December 2, 2019', 'location': 'China', 'region': 'Asia', 'url': 'http://outbreaknewstoday.com/plague-in-china-an-update-and-review-39580/', 'disease': 'unknown', 'body': ['By NewsDesk\xa0\xa0', 'According to Chinese officials, there has been 5 human plague cases in China in 2019.', 'In this video, the third on this topic in less than a month, I look at the case from Gansu that occurred in September but wasn’t reported on any meaningful scale.', 'I also look at the most recent case out of Inner Mongolia–the 5th case.', 'There are issues with the rat population in Inner Mongolia, and I look at some reporting on that.

In 2015, the mcr-1 gene was discovered in China and subsequently identified in other countries including Denmark, Germany, Vietnam, Spain, and the USA among others [1], raising fears that bacteria may acquire combined colistin and carbapenem resistance, making them multi-drug resistant.', 'Two studies published today come at an important time in China. Colistin, which has been used extensively in farming in China since the 1980s, was recently banned for use in agriculture, and will soon be introduced in clinical use for the first time.', 'The first study, led by Professor Timothy Walsh at Cardiff University (UK) and Professor Jianzhong Shen at the China Agricultural University, looked at the prevalence of bacteria carrying the mcr-1 resistance gene in human infections in two hospitals in Zheijang and Guangdong provinces across 8 years. Among more than 17000 bacterial isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76/5332 samples of E coli and 13/348 samples of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study is the first to look at risk factors for clinical mcr-1 infection and found that people who had used antibiotics (particularly carbapenems) before hospitalisation were more likely to carry bacteria with the mcr-1 resistance gene. Among 146 isolates of mcr-1-positive E coli identified, only five were also carbapenem resistant.', '“The emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, such as colistin. The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily. Our study finds that there are significant risk factors for the spread of mcr-1 infections, beyond just rural living and diet. The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,” says Professor Tim Walsh [2].', 'The second study, led by researchers at Zhejiang University (China), tested samples from over 2000 bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China. Of the 1495 E coli samples, 20 were mcr-1 positive, one of which was also carbapenem resistant. Patients with mcr-1-positive infections were all treated successfully with other antibiotics.', '“The most troubling problem for clinicians would be the transfer of colistin resistance to a bacterium which is already carbapenem resistant, making it multi-drug resistance. This does not appear to have happened to any great extent in clinical isolates, but the situation should be monitored carefully as the country prepares to introduce colistin for use in humans,” says Professor Yunsong Yu, Zhejiang University [2].', 'Discussing the findings from both papers in a linked Comment, Professor David Paterson, University of Queensland (Australia) and Associate Professor David van Duin, University of North Carolina (US) write: “at this stage we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via mcr-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China. However, prior use of carbapenems was a risk factor for mcr-1 producing E coli, perhaps implying that the intersection between carbapenem resistance and the presence of this colistin resistance mechanism may yet be seen in the future. Furthermore, the spread of mcr-1 into globally widespread and virulent strains of E coli such as ST-131 is cause for ongoing concern and surveillance.', 'He adds: “After carbapenems, new antibiotics will become available for clinical use in human medicine in China. There are risks that low-cost generic copies of these new antibiotics will be used in agriculture. We must be vigilant to this possibility and urge Chinese authorities to proactively prohibit use of these critical antibiotics outside of appropriate human use. Without such interventions, there will doubtless be more serious problems than mcr-1 seen in China in the near future.”']}, {'title': 'China: Wuhan officials report 17 additional coronavirus cases', 'date': 'January 18, 2020', 'location': 'China', 'region': 'Asia', 'url': 'http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-wuhan-officials-report-17-additional-coronavirus-cases-49056/', 'disease': 'unknown', 'body': ['By NewsDesk\xa0\xa0', 'In an ', '(2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan City, China, the\xa0Wuhan Municipal Commission of Health ', ' 17 additional cases, bringing the total in the city to 62.', 'No additional deaths were reported.

In 2015, the mcr-1 gene was discovered in China and subsequently identified in other countries including Denmark, Germany, Vietnam, Spain, and the USA among others [1], raising fears that bacteria may acquire combined colistin and carbapenem resistance, making them multi-drug resistant.', 'Two studies published today come at an important time in China. Colistin, which has been used extensively in farming in China since the 1980s, was recently banned for use in agriculture, and will soon be introduced in clinical use for the first time.', 'The first study, led by Professor Timothy Walsh at Cardiff University (UK) and Professor Jianzhong Shen at the China Agricultural University, looked at the prevalence of bacteria carrying the mcr-1 resistance gene in human infections in two hospitals in Zheijang and Guangdong provinces across 8 years. Among more than 17000 bacterial isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76/5332 samples of E coli and 13/348 samples of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study is the first to look at risk factors for clinical mcr-1 infection and found that people who had used antibiotics (particularly carbapenems) before hospitalisation were more likely to carry bacteria with the mcr-1 resistance gene. Among 146 isolates of mcr-1-positive E coli identified, only five were also carbapenem resistant.', '“The emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, such as colistin. The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily. Our study finds that there are significant risk factors for the spread of mcr-1 infections, beyond just rural living and diet. The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,” says Professor Tim Walsh [2].', 'The second study, led by researchers at Zhejiang University (China), tested samples from over 2000 bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China. Of the 1495 E coli samples, 20 were mcr-1 positive, one of which was also carbapenem resistant. Patients with mcr-1-positive infections were all treated successfully with other antibiotics.', '“The most troubling problem for clinicians would be the transfer of colistin resistance to a bacterium which is already carbapenem resistant, making it multi-drug resistance. This does not appear to have happened to any great extent in clinical isolates, but the situation should be monitored carefully as the country prepares to introduce colistin for use in humans,” says Professor Yunsong Yu, Zhejiang University [2].', 'Discussing the findings from both papers in a linked Comment, Professor David Paterson, University of Queensland (Australia) and Associate Professor David van Duin, University of North Carolina (US) write: “at this stage we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via mcr-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China. However, prior use of carbapenems was a risk factor for mcr-1 producing E coli, perhaps implying that the intersection between carbapenem resistance and the presence of this colistin resistance mechanism may yet be seen in the future. Furthermore, the spread of mcr-1 into globally widespread and virulent strains of E coli such as ST-131 is cause for ongoing concern and surveillance.', 'He adds: “After carbapenems, new antibiotics will become available for clinical use in human medicine in China.

In 2015, the mcr-1 gene was discovered in China and subsequently identified in other countries including Denmark, Germany, Vietnam, Spain, and the USA among others [1], raising fears that bacteria may acquire combined colistin and carbapenem resistance, making them multi-drug resistant.', 'Two studies published today come at an important time in China. Colistin, which has been used extensively in farming in China since the 1980s, was recently banned for use in agriculture, and will soon be introduced in clinical use for the first time.', 'The first study, led by Professor Timothy Walsh at Cardiff University (UK) and Professor Jianzhong Shen at the China Agricultural University, looked at the prevalence of bacteria carrying the mcr-1 resistance gene in human infections in two hospitals in Zheijang and Guangdong provinces across 8 years. Among more than 17000 bacterial isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76/5332 samples of E coli and 13/348 samples of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study is the first to look at risk factors for clinical mcr-1 infection and found that people who had used antibiotics (particularly carbapenems) before hospitalisation were more likely to carry bacteria with the mcr-1 resistance gene. Among 146 isolates of mcr-1-positive E coli identified, only five were also carbapenem resistant.', '“The emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, such as colistin. The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily. Our study finds that there are significant risk factors for the spread of mcr-1 infections, beyond just rural living and diet. The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,” says Professor Tim Walsh [2].', 'The second study, led by researchers at Zhejiang University (China), tested samples from over 2000 bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China. Of the 1495 E coli samples, 20 were mcr-1 positive, one of which was also carbapenem resistant. Patients with mcr-1-positive infections were all treated successfully with other antibiotics.', '“The most troubling problem for clinicians would be the transfer of colistin resistance to a bacterium which is already carbapenem resistant, making it multi-drug resistance. This does not appear to have happened to any great extent in clinical isolates, but the situation should be monitored carefully as the country prepares to introduce colistin for use in humans,” says Professor Yunsong Yu, Zhejiang University [2].', 'Discussing the findings from both papers in a linked Comment, Professor David Paterson, University of Queensland (Australia) and Associate Professor David van Duin, University of North Carolina (US) write: “at this stage we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via mcr-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China. However, prior use of carbapenems was a risk factor for mcr-1 producing E coli, perhaps implying that the intersection between carbapenem resistance and the presence of this colistin resistance mechanism may yet be seen in the future. Furthermore, the spread of mcr-1 into globally widespread and virulent strains of E coli such as ST-131 is cause for ongoing concern and surveillance.', 'He adds: “After carbapenems, new antibiotics will become available for clinical use in human medicine in China.

In 2015, the mcr-1 gene was discovered in China and subsequently identified in other countries including Denmark, Germany, Vietnam, Spain, and the USA among others [1], raising fears that bacteria may acquire combined colistin and carbapenem resistance, making them multi-drug resistant.', 'Two studies published today come at an important time in China. Colistin, which has been used extensively in farming in China since the 1980s, was recently banned for use in agriculture, and will soon be introduced in clinical use for the first time.', 'The first study, led by Professor Timothy Walsh at Cardiff University (UK) and Professor Jianzhong Shen at the China Agricultural University, looked at the prevalence of bacteria carrying the mcr-1 resistance gene in human infections in two hospitals in Zheijang and Guangdong provinces across 8 years. Among more than 17000 bacterial isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76/5332 samples of E coli and 13/348 samples of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study is the first to look at risk factors for clinical mcr-1 infection and found that people who had used antibiotics (particularly carbapenems) before hospitalisation were more likely to carry bacteria with the mcr-1 resistance gene. Among 146 isolates of mcr-1-positive E coli identified, only five were also carbapenem resistant.', '“The emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, such as colistin. The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily. Our study finds that there are significant risk factors for the spread of mcr-1 infections, beyond just rural living and diet. The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,” says Professor Tim Walsh [2].', 'The second study, led by researchers at Zhejiang University (China), tested samples from over 2000 bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China. Of the 1495 E coli samples, 20 were mcr-1 positive, one of which was also carbapenem resistant. Patients with mcr-1-positive infections were all treated successfully with other antibiotics.', '“The most troubling problem for clinicians would be the transfer of colistin resistance to a bacterium which is already carbapenem resistant, making it multi-drug resistance. This does not appear to have happened to any great extent in clinical isolates, but the situation should be monitored carefully as the country prepares to introduce colistin for use in humans,” says Professor Yunsong Yu, Zhejiang University [2].', 'Discussing the findings from both papers in a linked Comment, Professor David Paterson, University of Queensland (Australia) and Associate Professor David van Duin, University of North Carolina (US) write: “at this stage we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via mcr-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China. However, prior use of carbapenems was a risk factor for mcr-1 producing E coli, perhaps implying that the intersection between carbapenem resistance and the presence of this colistin resistance mechanism may yet be seen in the future. Furthermore, the spread of mcr-1 into globally widespread and virulent strains of E coli such as ST-131 is cause for ongoing concern and surveillance.', 'He adds: “After carbapenems, new antibiotics will become available for clinical use in human medicine in China. There are risks that low-cost generic copies of these new antibiotics will be used in agriculture. We must be vigilant to this possibility and urge Chinese authorities to proactively prohibit use of these critical antibiotics outside of appropriate human use. Without such interventions, there will doubtless be more serious problems than mcr-1 seen in China in the near future.”']}, {'title': 'H7N9 avian influenza: 12 more cases reported in China', 'date': 'June 10, 2017', 'location': 'China', 'region': 'Asia', 'url': 'http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h7n9-avian-influenza-12-more-cases-reported-in-china-30708/', 'disease': 'H7N9', 'body': ['The Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission announced an additional\xa012 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) from June 2 to 8.', 'The eight male and four female patients, aged from\xa04 to 68, had onset from May 20 to June 3.

In 2015, the mcr-1 gene was discovered in China and subsequently identified in other countries including Denmark, Germany, Vietnam, Spain, and the USA among others [1], raising fears that bacteria may acquire combined colistin and carbapenem resistance, making them multi-drug resistant.', 'Two studies published today come at an important time in China.

Among more than 17000 bacterial isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76/5332 samples of E coli and 13/348 samples of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study is the first to look at risk factors for clinical mcr-1 infection and found that people who had used antibiotics (particularly carbapenems) before hospitalisation were more likely to carry bacteria with the mcr-1 resistance gene. Among 146 isolates of mcr-1-positive E coli identified, only five were also carbapenem resistant.', '“The emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, such as colistin. The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily. Our study finds that there are significant risk factors for the spread of mcr-1 infections, beyond just rural living and diet. The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,” says Professor Tim Walsh [2].', 'The second study, led by researchers at Zhejiang University (China), tested samples from over 2000 bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China. Of the 1495 E coli samples, 20 were mcr-1 positive, one of which was also carbapenem resistant. Patients with mcr-1-positive infections were all treated successfully with other antibiotics.', '“The most troubling problem for clinicians would be the transfer of colistin resistance to a bacterium which is already carbapenem resistant, making it multi-drug resistance. This does not appear to have happened to any great extent in clinical isolates, but the situation should be monitored carefully as the country prepares to introduce colistin for use in humans,” says Professor Yunsong Yu, Zhejiang University [2].', 'Discussing the findings from both papers in a linked Comment, Professor David Paterson, University of Queensland (Australia) and Associate Professor David van Duin, University of North Carolina (US) write: “at this stage we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via mcr-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China. However, prior use of carbapenems was a risk factor for mcr-1 producing E coli, perhaps implying that the intersection between carbapenem resistance and the presence of this colistin resistance mechanism may yet be seen in the future. Furthermore, the spread of mcr-1 into globally widespread and virulent strains of E coli such as ST-131 is cause for ongoing concern and surveillance.', 'He adds: “After carbapenems, new antibiotics will become available for clinical use in human medicine in China. There are risks that low-cost generic copies of these new antibiotics will be used in agriculture. We must be vigilant to this possibility and urge Chinese authorities to proactively prohibit use of these critical antibiotics outside of appropriate human use. Without such interventions, there will doubtless be more serious problems than mcr-1 seen in China in the near future.”']}, {'title': 'H7N9 avian influenza: 12 more cases reported in China', 'date': 'June 10, 2017', 'location': 'China', 'region': 'Asia', 'url': 'http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h7n9-avian-influenza-12-more-cases-reported-in-china-30708/', 'disease': 'H7N9', 'body': ['The Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission announced an additional\xa012 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) from June 2 to 8.', 'The eight male and four female patients, aged from\xa04 to 68, had onset from May 20 to June 3.

In 2015, the mcr-1 gene was discovered in China and subsequently identified in other countries including Denmark, Germany, Vietnam, Spain, and the USA among others [1], raising fears that bacteria may acquire combined colistin and carbapenem resistance, making them multi-drug resistant.', 'Two studies published today come at an important time in China. Colistin, which has been used extensively in farming in China since the 1980s, was recently banned for use in agriculture, and will soon be introduced in clinical use for the first time.', 'The first study, led by Professor Timothy Walsh at Cardiff University (UK) and Professor Jianzhong Shen at the China Agricultural University, looked at the prevalence of bacteria carrying the mcr-1 resistance gene in human infections in two hospitals in Zheijang and Guangdong provinces across 8 years. Among more than 17000 bacterial isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76/5332 samples of E coli and 13/348 samples of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study is the first to look at risk factors for clinical mcr-1 infection and found that people who had used antibiotics (particularly carbapenems) before hospitalisation were more likely to carry bacteria with the mcr-1 resistance gene. Among 146 isolates of mcr-1-positive E coli identified, only five were also carbapenem resistant.', '“The emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, such as colistin. The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily. Our study finds that there are significant risk factors for the spread of mcr-1 infections, beyond just rural living and diet. The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,” says Professor Tim Walsh [2].', 'The second study, led by researchers at Zhejiang University (China), tested samples from over 2000 bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China. Of the 1495 E coli samples, 20 were mcr-1 positive, one of which was also carbapenem resistant. Patients with mcr-1-positive infections were all treated successfully with other antibiotics.', '“The most troubling problem for clinicians would be the transfer of colistin resistance to a bacterium which is already carbapenem resistant, making it multi-drug resistance. This does not appear to have happened to any great extent in clinical isolates, but the situation should be monitored carefully as the country prepares to introduce colistin for use in humans,” says Professor Yunsong Yu, Zhejiang University [2].', 'Discussing the findings from both papers in a linked Comment, Professor David Paterson, University of Queensland (Australia) and Associate Professor David van Duin, University of North Carolina (US) write: “at this stage we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via mcr-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China. However, prior use of carbapenems was a risk factor for mcr-1 producing E coli, perhaps implying that the intersection between carbapenem resistance and the presence of this colistin resistance mechanism may yet be seen in the future. Furthermore, the spread of mcr-1 into globally widespread and virulent strains of E coli such as ST-131 is cause for ongoing concern and surveillance.', 'He adds: “After carbapenems, new antibiotics will become available for clinical use in human medicine in China. There are risks that low-cost generic copies of these new antibiotics will be used in agriculture. We must be vigilant to this possibility and urge Chinese authorities to proactively prohibit use of these critical antibiotics outside of appropriate human use. Without such interventions, there will doubtless be more serious problems than mcr-1 seen in China in the near future.”']}, {'title': 'China reports another 14 H7N9 avian influenza cases', 'date': 'April 8, 2017', 'location': 'China', 'region': 'Asia', 'url': 'http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-reports-another-14-h7n9-avian-influenza-cases-82691/', 'disease': 'H7N9', 'body': ['The Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission announced\xa014 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9), including one death, were recorded from March 31 to April 6.', 'The 10 male and four female patients, aged from 38 to 70, had their onset from March 14 to April 4.\xa0Three of the cases were\xa0in Beijing, two cases each in Hunan and Jiangsu, and one case each\xa0in Chongqing, Fujian, Guizhou, Henan, Shandong, Tibet and Zhejiang.

In 2015, the mcr-1 gene was discovered in China and subsequently identified in other countries including Denmark, Germany, Vietnam, Spain, and the USA among others [1], raising fears that bacteria may acquire combined colistin and carbapenem resistance, making them multi-drug resistant.', 'Two studies published today come at an important time in China. Colistin, which has been used extensively in farming in China since the 1980s, was recently banned for use in agriculture, and will soon be introduced in clinical use for the first time.', 'The first study, led by Professor Timothy Walsh at Cardiff University (UK) and Professor Jianzhong Shen at the China Agricultural University, looked at the prevalence of bacteria carrying the mcr-1 resistance gene in human infections in two hospitals in Zheijang and Guangdong provinces across 8 years. Among more than 17000 bacterial isolates associated with infection, mcr-1 was detected in 76/5332 samples of E coli and 13/348 samples of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study is the first to look at risk factors for clinical mcr-1 infection and found that people who had used antibiotics (particularly carbapenems) before hospitalisation were more likely to carry bacteria with the mcr-1 resistance gene. Among 146 isolates of mcr-1-positive E coli identified, only five were also carbapenem resistant.', '“The emergence of mcr-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, such as colistin. The withdrawal of the drug from agricultural use, and its introduction in the clinic might reduce colistin resistance rates in the community, and increase resistance in hospitals where they may be harder to treat or spread more easily. Our study finds that there are significant risk factors for the spread of mcr-1 infections, beyond just rural living and diet. The spread of colistin resistant bacteria will likely worsen when the drug is introduced in humans,” says Professor Tim Walsh [2].', 'The second study, led by researchers at Zhejiang University (China), tested samples from over 2000 bloodstream infections at 28 hospitals in China. Of the 1495 E coli samples, 20 were mcr-1 positive, one of which was also carbapenem resistant. Patients with mcr-1-positive infections were all treated successfully with other antibiotics.', '“The most troubling problem for clinicians would be the transfer of colistin resistance to a bacterium which is already carbapenem resistant, making it multi-drug resistance. This does not appear to have happened to any great extent in clinical isolates, but the situation should be monitored carefully as the country prepares to introduce colistin for use in humans,” says Professor Yunsong Yu, Zhejiang University [2].', 'Discussing the findings from both papers in a linked Comment, Professor David Paterson, University of Queensland (Australia) and Associate Professor David van Duin, University of North Carolina (US) write: “at this stage we can conclude that the doomsday scenario of convergence of carbapenem resistance and colistin resistance (via mcr-1) has not yet occurred to any great extent in China. However, prior use of carbapenems was a risk factor for mcr-1 producing E coli, perhaps implying that the intersection between carbapenem resistance and the presence of this colistin resistance mechanism may yet be seen in the future. Furthermore, the spread of mcr-1 into globally widespread and virulent strains of E coli such as ST-131 is cause for ongoing concern and surveillance.', 'He adds: “After carbapenems, new antibiotics will become available for clinical use in human medicine in China. There are risks that low-cost generic copies of these new antibiotics will be used in agriculture. We must be vigilant to this possibility and urge Chinese authorities to proactively prohibit use of these critical antibiotics outside of appropriate human use. Without such interventions, there will doubtless be more serious problems than mcr-1 seen in China in the near future.”']}, {'title': 'China reports another 14 H7N9 avian influenza cases', 'date': 'April 8, 2017', 'location': 'China', 'region': 'Asia', 'url': 'http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-reports-another-14-h7n9-avian-influenza-cases-82691/', 'disease': 'H7N9', 'body': ['The Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission announced\xa014 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9), including one death, were recorded from March 31 to April 6.', 'The 10 male and four female patients, aged from 38 to 70, had their onset from March 14 to April 4.\xa0Three of the cases were\xa0in Beijing, two cases each in Hunan and Jiangsu, and one case each\xa0in Chongqing, Fujian, Guizhou, Henan, Shandong, Tibet and Zhejiang.

Although there is no evidence yet that the B.1.1.7 variant can evade COVID-19 vaccines, public health officials fear its relatively high rate of spread will significantly worsen the pandemic before vaccines can end it.', 'Standard swab tests for the coronavirus check for distinctive genetic sequences at three sites on the viral genome; the B.1.1.7 variant, due to its mutations, shows up as positive for two of those sites, but negative for the third site, which is within the virus’s spike gene.', 'The new analysis of roughly 500,000 Helix test results since July 2020 revealed that this two-of-three pattern, known as S-gene target failure, or SGTF, became consistently evident at a low frequency (0.2 percent) in mid-October. By the third week of February, it had risen to a frequency of 10.6 percent and was detected in patients from 25 different U.S. states and territories.', 'The SGTF pattern can occur with other SARS-CoV-2 variants that have spike gene mutations, but the researchers found by sequencing every SGTF sample they had from December through February, 662 of the 986 samples (67 percent) contained the B.1.1.7 variant. This suggests that the SGTF pattern on the swab tests can provide a quick albeit rough indication of B.1.1.7 prevalence.', 'The analysis also indicated that B.1.1.7 since December has accounted for a rapidly rising proportion of SGTF results–for example, reaching about 95 percent in California by mid-January. In addition to the 659 B.1.1.7 cases they detected via the SGTF method the researchers found three other cases of the B.1.1.7 variant among samples gathered as part of unbiased SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance efforts in California.', 'The 662 instances of B.1.1.7 sequenced in the study were from samples gathered in 10 U.S. states, although the researchers note that other testing labs covering a total of 33 U.S. states and territories have by now reported to the CDC at least one B.1.1.7 case.', 'The researchers’ family tree-type analysis of the detected B.1.1.7 sequences show the variant has been introduced to the U.S. multiple times since at least late November 2020, especially in California and Florida, and in periods coinciding with increased travel, including Thanksgiving week.', 'The scientists also found that the variant, on the whole, appears to be spreading 40-50 percent faster than the variants of SARS-CoV-2 that previously dominated. They estimated that by the first week of February 2021, B.1.1.7 made up about 4.3 percent of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., including 4.2 percent of cases in California and about 11.5 percent of cases in Florida.']}, {'title': 'COVID-19 antiviral: FDA oks human clinical trials for EIDD-2801', 'date': 'April 8, 2020', 'location': 'the United States', 'region': 'Drugs and antibiotics', 'url': 'http://outbreaknewstoday.com/covid-19-antiviral-fda-oks-human-clinical-trials-for-eidd-2801/', 'disease': 'COVID-19', 'body': ['Human clinical trials may begin on an antiviral compound which was discovered and developed by Emory University and shows promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19.', 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an Investigational New Drug application by Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE), LLC, wholly owned by Emory University, for EIDD-2801.

Residents in nursing homes and the population over the age of 85 were the first to be offered vaccination in Norway. By week 11 in the over-85 year age group, 89 % have received at least the first vaccine dose and 81 %\xa0 have received the second vaccine dose. In the 80-84 year age group, 83 % have been vaccinated with at least the first dose and 54 % with the second dose. Vaccination of people in the 75-84 age group is ongoing, so the proportion of people who are vaccinated is currently lower in this group.', '“During the last five weeks, transmission has increased sharply again among most age groups in Norway, especially among the youngest. However, a similar pattern is not seen among either the over-85 or the 80-84 years age groups, who have the highest vaccination coverage. This may mean that vaccination is already helping to protect the groups at greatest risk of a severe disease course if they become infected, says Geir Bukholm. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely as more and more groups are offered a vaccine,” he adds.']}]

In New Mexico, cases of congenital syphilis – meaning syphilis among newborns – have increased sharply in recent years, from just 6 cases in 2017 to an alarming 26 cases in 2019.\xa0 This follows national trends, with far more syphilis cases among heterosexual women of child-bearing age over the past five years.', 'In states with high syphilis prevalence, current guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend testing of pregnant women on three separate occasions: 1) at the first prenatal visit, 2) during the third trimester, and 3) at delivery.', 'However, language in the New Mexico Public Health Act related to syphilis has not been revised in over 40 years. As such, the language is out of step with current medical knowledge and CDC guidance.', 'Senate Bill 184, carried by Senator Elizabeth “Liz” Stefanics (Santa Fe) and Representative Joanne J. Ferrary (Las Cruces), seeks to address this challenge. The proposed legislation will update the Public Health Act, Section 24-1-10, to remove outdated language requiring a single blood test as well as outdated language about how testing is implemented.

In New Mexico, cases of congenital syphilis – meaning syphilis among newborns – have increased sharply in recent years, from just 6 cases in 2017 to an alarming 26 cases in 2019.\xa0 This follows national trends, with far more syphilis cases among heterosexual women of child-bearing age over the past five years.', 'In states with high syphilis prevalence, current guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend testing of pregnant women on three separate occasions: 1) at the first prenatal visit, 2) during the third trimester, and 3) at delivery.', 'However, language in the New Mexico Public Health Act related to syphilis has not been revised in over 40 years. As such, the language is out of step with current medical knowledge and CDC guidance.', 'Senate Bill 184, carried by Senator Elizabeth “Liz” Stefanics (Santa Fe) and Representative Joanne J. Ferrary (Las Cruces), seeks to address this challenge. The proposed legislation will update the Public Health Act, Section 24-1-10, to remove outdated language requiring a single blood test as well as outdated language about how testing is implemented. In its place will be simple language directing all physicians who examine pregnant women for conditions related to pregnancy to follow current CDC guidelines, which reflect the best science and medical knowledge. Increased testing of pregnant women can catch syphilis early, allowing timely treatment that prevents infections from being passed to their children.
